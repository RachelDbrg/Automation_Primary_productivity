  abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used in ecology. In theory, SDMs capture (at least part of) species' ecological niches and can be used to make inferences about the distribution of suitable habitat for species of interest. Because habitat suitability is expected to influence population demography, SDMs have been used to estimate a variety of population parameters, from occurrence to genetic diversity. However, a critical look at the ability of SDMs to predict independent data across different aspects of population biology is lacking. Here, we systematically reviewed the literature, retrieving 201 studies that tested predictions from SDMs against independent assessments of occurrence, abundance, population performance, and genetic diversity. Although there is some support for the ability of SDMs to predict occurrence ( 53\% of studies depending on how support was assessed), the predictive performance of these models declines progressively from occurrence to abundance, to population mean fitness, to genetic diversity. At the same time, we observed higher success among studies that evaluated performance for single versus multiple species, pointing to a possible publication bias. Thus, the limited accuracy of SDMs reported here may reflect the best-case scenario. We discuss the limitations of these models and provide specific recommendations for their use for different applications going forward. However, we emphasize that predictions from SDMs, especially when used to inform conservation decisions, should be treated as hypotheses to be tested with independent data rather than as stand-ins for the population parameters we seek to know.},

The models assume that the predator experiences density dependence via some mechanism other than prey depletion. The models also assume that the predator's functional response to each prey decreases as the density of the other prey species increases. This can occur either because of predator satiation or predator switching. The results suggest that positive indirect effects of one prey on the equilibrium density of others should occur frequently, especially when there is predator switching. Decreasing the mortality rate of one prey or adding a prey species may make it easier for additional prey species to invade the system and coexist. This occurs because the resulting decrease in the predator's functional response is greater than its positive numerical response. In many cases, different magnitudes of perturbation to one prey species will have opposite effects on the population density of the other prey species.},

  abstract = {▪ Abstract\hspace{0.6em} Recent theories regarding the evolution of predator-prey interactions is reviewed. This includes theory about the dynamics and stability of both populations and traits, as well as theory predicting how predatory and anti-predator traits should respond to environmental changes. Evolution can stabilize or destabilize interactions; stability is most likely when only the predator evolves, or when traits in one or both species are under strong stabilizing selection. Stability seems least likely when there is coevolution and a bi-directional axis of prey vulnerability. When population cycles exist, adaptation may either increase or decrease the amplitude of those cycles. An increase in the defensive ability of prey is less likely to produce evolutionary counter-measures in its partner than is a comparable increase in attack ability of the predator. Increased productivity may increase or decrease offensive and defensive adaptations. The apparent predominance of evolutionary responses of prey to predators over those of predators to prey is in general accord with equilibrium theory, but theory on stability may be difficult to confirm or refute. Recent work on geographically structured populations promises to advance our understanding of the evolution of predator-prey interactions.},

  abstract = {The role of habitat choice behavior in the dynamics of predator-prey systems is explored using simple mathematical models. The models assume a three-species food chain in which each population is distributed across two or more habitats. The predator and prey adjust their locations dynamically to maximize individual per capita growth, while the prey's resource has a low rate of random movement. The two consumer species have Type II functional responses. For many parameter sets, the populations cycle, with predator and prey ``chasing'' each other back and forth between habitats. The cycles are driven by the aggregation of prey, which is advantageous because the predator's saturating functional response induces a short-term positive density dependence in prey fitness. The advantage of aggregation in a patch is only temporary because resources are depleted and predators move to or reproduce faster in the habitat with the largest number of prey, perpetuating the cycle. Such spatial cycling can stabilize population densities and qualitatively change the responses of population densities to environmental perturbations. These models show that the coupled processes of moving to habitats with higher fitness in predator and prey may often fail to produce ideal free distributions across habitats.},

In order to examine the effect of the variable carrying capacity on the prey{\textendash}predator dynamics, the two models were analyzed qualitatively using stability analysis and numerical solutions for the prey, and the predator population densities were obtained. Results on global stability and Hopf bifurcation of certain equilibrium points have been also presented.

Additionally, multi-trophic interactions that link processes across trophic levels have received increasing attention as a possible key driver. Given that both are integral to natural ecosystems, their interactive effect should be evident but has remained hidden. We address this issue by analysing diversity{\textendash}productivity relationships in a simulation experiment of producer communities nested within complex food-webs, manipulating resource-use complementarity and multi-trophic animal richness. We show that these two mechanisms interactively create diverse communities of complementary producer species. This shapes diversity{\textendash}productivity relationships such that their joint contribution generally exceeds their individual effects. Specifically, multi-trophic interactions in animal-rich ecosystems facilitate producer coexistence by preventing competitive exclusion despite overlaps in resource-use, which increases the realised complementarity. The interdependence of food-webs and producer complementarity in creating biodiversity{\textendash}productivity relationships highlights the importance to adopt a multi-trophic perspective on biodiversity{\textendash}ecosystem functioning relationships.},

We first consider the prey{\textendash}predator with Holling type II functional response where the growth of prey is assumed to be logistic in the sense of predator in one-dimensional space.

However, the effect of climate change on those processes and their interactions is poorly understood. We used an ecophysiological-based mechanistic landscape model to study those processes and their interactions and predict the future productivity and composition under climate change scenarios (RCP) for 300 years (2010{\textendash}2310). The effects of climate change and wildfires on forest composition, biomass carbon sequestration and storage, and mortality were assessed in three management units of Quebec boreal forest, distributed along a longitudinal gradient from west to east: North-of-Quebec (MU1), Saguenay{\textendash}Lac-Saint-Jean (MU2), and C{\^o}te-Nord region (MU3). Coniferous mortality variation was explained by competitive exclusion and wildfires, which are related to climate change. In the studied MU, we found a decrease in coniferous pure occupancy at the landscape scale and an increase in mixed deciduous forests in MU1 and MU2, and an increase in mixed coniferous, mainly black spruce and balsam fir in MU3. On the other hand, for extreme scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), in the absence of broadleaves dispersal, the open woodland occupancy could increase to more than 8, 22, and 10\% in MU1, MU2, and MU3 respectively. Also, climate change might increase overall biomass carbon stock two times for RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 scenarios compared to the baseline this may be explained by the extension of the growing season and the reduction of potential cold-temperature injuries. Generally, western regions were more sensitive to climate changes than the eastern regions (MU3), in fact under RCP8.5 biomass carbon stock will be decreasing in the long-term for MU1 compared to the current climate. This study provides a good starting point to support future research on the multiple factors affecting forest C budget under global change.},

Their functional and numerical responses to changes in prey density, and their influence on small rodent numbers, are discussed. The shape of the functional response curve of the predators may be important for the dynamics of the predator-prey system. Generalists with access to alternative prey tend to stabilize rodent numbers, as do migrating specialists, whereas resident specialists may be destabilizing. Field studies on cyclic rodent populations point to the importance of predation during and after the decline phase, and indicate that predation may increase the amplitude and prolong the period of the cycles. Other studies indicate a strong influence of predation on rodent numbers in areas with a diversified prey and predator fauna. ///

  abstract = {Protist plankton comprise phytoplankton (incapable of phagotrophy), protozooplankton (incapable of phototrophy) and mixoplankton (capable of phototrophy and phagotrophy). Of these, only phytoplankton and zooplankton are typically described in models. Over the last decade, however, the importance of mixoplankton across all marine biomes has risen to prominence. We thus need descriptions of mixoplankton within marine models. Here we present a simple yet flexible N-based model describing any one of the five basic patterns of protist plankton: phytoplankton, protozooplankton, and the three functional groups of mixoplankton: general non-constitutive mixoplankton (GNCM), specialist non-constitutive mixoplankton (SNCM), and constitutive mixoplankton (CM). By manipulation of a few input switch values, the same model can be used to describe any of these patterns, while adjustment of salient features, such as the percent of C-fixation required for mixotrophic growth, and the rate of phototrophic prey ingestion required to enable growth of GNCM and SNCM types, readily provides fine tuning. Example outputs are presented showing how the performance of these different protist configurations accords with expectations (set against empirical evidence). Simulations demonstrate clear niche separations between these protist functional groups according to nutrient, prey and light resource availabilities. This addition to classic NPZ plankton models provides for the exploration of the implications of mixoplankton activity in a simple yet robust fashion.},

  abstract = {This chapter discusses the predicted, observed, and uncertain effects related to lichen and climate change together with the habitats of vulnerable lichens, with special attention to mountain tops in the tropics{\textemdash}the most likely place for possible extinction of lichens as a result of global warming. Lichens have been observed to respond rapidly to climate change. So far, the changes are as expected with a rather rapid increase of (sub)tropical species in temperate areas, and a gradual decrease of some boreo-alpine elements. No lichens have, so far, been reported to be seriously threatened by climate change. Marked shifts in occurrence and distribution have been predicted based on known habitat preferences and projected climate change. Lichens, like most cryptogams, tend to be widespread, much more so than phanerogams or land animals. Also, many of the species seem to be capable of rather rapid dispersal, as shown by the recent arrival of some (sub)tropical species in a temperate area. Lichens are unequivocally responding to global change. The effects are, so far, apparent only in the last two decades and in the temperate region only. Lichens have indirectly suffered from global change effects in arctic regions. The most severe effects of climate change, leading to probable extinctions, are expected on high mountains in tropical regions.},

We use numerical simulations to further illustrate the impact changing the predator per capita consumption rate has on the basin of attraction of the stable equilibrium points, as well as the impact of changing the efficiency with which predators convert consumed prey into new predators.},

From our result of the temporal model, we identify regions in parameter space in which Turing instability in the spatio-temporal model is expected and we show numerical evidence where the Turing instability leads to spatio-temporal periodic solutions. Subsequently, we analyse these instabilities. We use simulations to illustrate the behaviour of both the temporal and spatio-temporal model.},

Diet was estimated using the microhistological analysis of plant epidermis in deer pellet-groups. The sampling was from 1993 to 1994. From the rainy to dry season, the richness and diversity of the families and species in the diet increased and botanical composition changed. Deer selected 82 plant species from 20 families; however, 12 species represented 50\% of the annual diet. Flowers and fruits of arboreal species were important during the dry season, as were young leaves of shrub and vine species during the rainy season. Despite the small size of white-tailed deer in this tropical dry forest study area, foraging strategies there were similar to those observed in temperate forests.},

Population time series models indicated a broad scale decline averaging 30\% in moose populations across the Boreal Plain Ecozone since 2000 relative to the long-term (1985 to 2015) cumulative mean population size. Demographic patterns and rates of population change were variable among and within populations across years. We found an inverse relationship between adult sex ratio (bull:cow) and population density (R{$^2$} = 0.48, P {$<$} 0.001), which suggests negative population growth ({$\lambda$} {$<$} 1.0) when the adult sex ratio falls below a density-dependent threshold for population growth. Winter calf recruitment (calves/cow) was positively correlated (R{$^2$} = 0.12, P = 0.027) with adult sex ratio. Stable or increasing populations ({$\lambda$} {$\geq$} 1.0) tended to have lower adult sex ratios relative to winter calf recruitment ratios than declining populations. Population state and vital rate relationships are useful to assess population performance and guide science-based moose management strategies in a Management-byObjective decision-analytic framework.},

The model investigated here presents complex dynamics and high codimension bifurcations. In particular, nilpotent cusp singularity of order 3 and degenerate Hopf bifurcation of codimension 3 are completely analyzed. Remarkably it is the first time that three limit cycles are discovered in predator-prey models with multiplicative Allee effects. Moreover, a new unfolding of nilpotent saddle of codimension 3 with a fixed invariant line is discovered and fully developed, and the existence of codimension 2 heteroclinic bifurcation is proven. Our work extends the existing results of predator-prey systems with Allee effects. The bifurcation analysis and diagram allow us to give biological interpretations of predator-prey interactions.},

Disentangling network co-structure in multilayer networks is crucial to predict how biodiversity loss may affect the persistence of multispecies assemblages. Existing methods to analyse multilayer networks often fail to consider network co-structure. We present a new method to evaluate the modular co-structure of multilayer networks through the assessment of species degree co-distribution and network module composition. We focus on modular structure because of its high prevalence among ecological networks. We apply our method to two Lepidoptera-plant networks, one describing caterpillar-plant herbivory interactions and one representing adult Lepidoptera nectaring on flowers, thereby possibly pollinating them. More than 50\% of the species established either herbivory or visitation interactions, but not both. These species were over-represented among plants and lepidopterans, and were present in most modules in both networks. Similarity in module composition between networks was high but not different from random expectations. Our method clearly delineates the importance of interpreting multilayer module composition similarity in the light of the constraints imposed by network structure to predict the potential indirect effects of species loss through interconnected modular networks.},

  abstract = {A resource selection function is a model of the likelihood that an available spatial unit will be used by an animal, given its resource value. But how do we appropriately define availability? Step selection analysis deals with this problem at the scale of the observed positional data, by matching each `used step' (connecting two consecutive observed positions of the animal) with a set of `available steps' randomly sampled from a distribution of observed steps or their characteristics. Here we present a simple extension to this approach, termed integrated step selection analysis (iSSA), which relaxes the implicit assumption that observed movement attributes (i.e. velocities and their temporal autocorrelations) are independent of resource selection. Instead, iSSA relies on simultaneously estimating movement and resource selection parameters, thus allowing simple likelihood-based inference of resource selection within a mechanistic movement model. We provide theoretical underpinning of iSSA, as well as practical guidelines to its implementation. Using computer simulations, we evaluate the inferential and predictive capacity of iSSA compared to currently used methods. Our work demonstrates the utility of iSSA as a general, flexible and user-friendly approach for both evaluating a variety of ecological hypotheses, and predicting future ecological patterns.},

Three birds with tail-mounted transmitters were successfully tracked with the fourth, though not relocated for radio tracking, resighted the following breeding season. Two of these were breeding birds that continued to provision young during radio tracking. One neck-collared bird was found dead three days after transmitter attachment and the other neither relocated nor resighted. As mortality in one bird was potentially caused by the neck collar transmitter we recommend tail-mounted transmitters in future radio-tracking studies of Picathartidae. Home ranges, shown using minimum convex polygon and kernel estimation methods, were generally small ({$<$}0.5 km2) and centred around breeding sites. A minimum of 60 fixes were found to be sufficient for home range estimation.},

Here, we assessed the resilience of a forest ecosystem to an overabundant herbivore population by assessing changes in 19 functional traits for plant, 13 traits for ground beetle and 16 traits for songbird communities after six years of controlled browsing on Anticosti Island (Quebec, Canada). Our results indicated that plants were more responsive to 6 years of reduced browsing pressure than ground beetles and songbirds. However, co-inertia analysis revealed that ground beetle communities responded in a similar way than plant communities with stronger relationships between plant and ground beetle traits at reduced deer density, a pattern not detected between plant and songbird. High deer density favored plants species that reproduce vegetatively and with abiotic pollination and seed dispersal, traits implying little interaction with animal. On the other hand, traits found at reduced deer density mostly involved trophic interaction. For example, plants in this treatment had fleshy fruits and large seeds dispersed by birds or other animals whereas ground beetle species were carnivorous. Overall, our results suggest that plant communities recovered some functional components to overabundant herbivore populations, since most traits associated with undisturbed forests were reestablished after six years of deer reduction. The re-establishment of functional plant communities with traits involving trophic interaction induces changes in the ground-beetle trait community, but forest structure remains likely insufficiently heterogeneous to shift the songbird trait community within six years.},

Ecologists have examined statistical metrics and other properties of food webs, but mainly due to the uneven quality of the data, the results have proved controversial. The qualitative data on which those efforts rested treat trophic interactions as present or absent and disregard potentially huge variation in their magnitude, an approach similar to analyzing traffic without differentiating between highways and side roads. More appropriate data are now available and were used here to analyze the relationship between trophic complexity and diversity in 59 quantitative food webs from seven studies (14{\textendash}202 species) based on recently developed quantitative descriptors. Our results shed new light on food-web structure. First, webs are much simpler when considered quantitatively, and link density exhibits scale invariance or weak dependence on food-web size. Second, the ``constant connectance'' hypothesis is not supported: connectance decreases with web size in both qualitative and quantitative data. Complexity has occupied a central role in the discussion of food-web stability, and we explore the implications for this debate. Our findings indicate that larger webs are more richly endowed with the weak trophic interactions that recent theories show to be responsible for food-web stability.},

Our analysis reveals that the global marine biomass pyramid contains more consumers than producers, thus increasing the scope of previous observations on inverse food pyramids.

  abstract = {In many regions of the Iberian Peninsula, wild ungulates have disappeared and wolves Canis lupus often depend on garbage dumps and domestic animals. This paper represents an example of wild ungulate preferences of the Iberian wolf Canis lupus signatus in an environment with no human-wildlife conflicts, because wolves rarely predate on livestock. I studied the patterns of prey selection by the Iberian wolf during May 1998-October 2002 in northwestern Spain, in an area which supports a diverse community of wild ungulates and in which also domestic ungulates are present. My analysis of 593 wolf scats showed that wild ungulates were consumed preferentially over other prey (i.e. domestic ungulates, carnivores and lagomorphs). Roe deer Capreolus capreolus was the most important prey species followed by red deer Cervus elaphus and wild boar Sus scrofa. Domestic ungulates were poorly represented in the wolf diet. Predation frequencies of domestic and wild ungulates varied seasonally and between years. The consumption of roe deer and wild boar increased during the birthing season, probably because of the higher vulnerability of newly born animals; wolves predate mainly on juvenile roe deer and wild boar.},

It models the dynamics of one prey, the collared lemming, and four predators : the stoat, the Arctic fox, the long-tailed skua and the snowy owl. In the present short note, we first summarize how the model works in light of theory on seasonally forced predator-prey systems, with a focus on the temporal dynamics of predation rates. We show notably how the impact of generalist predation, which is able here to initiate population declines, differs slightly from that of generalist predation in other mechanistic models of rodent-mustelid interactions such as Turchin \&amp; Hanski (1997). We then provide a low-dimensional approximation with a single generalist predator compartment that mimics the essential features of the Traill island model: cycle periodicity, amplitude, shape, as well as generalist-induced declines. This simpler model should be broadly applicable to model other lemming populations that predominantly grow under the snow during the winter period. Matlab computer codes for Gilg et al. (2003), its two-dimensional approximation, as well as alternative lemming population dynamics models are provided.},

  abstract = {Clear-cutting is one of the most widespread forestry practices used in boreal forests. Clear-cutting of boreal forests in late successional stages could trigger reversion of successional trajectories back toward forests of earlier stages. Such successional setbacks could generate sustainability issues by prolonging the expected time to compositional recovery after clear-cutting. This could lead to overestimation of allowable cuts of economically important late-successional species if the occurrence of successional setbacks remains unassessed. Our objective was to assess whether clear-cutting without additional regeneration treatments has triggered successional setbacks. We studied post-clearcut successional trajectories by using forest inventory data in post-clearcut stands, in light of conceptual successional dynamics models. These data covered the actively managed boreal forest region of Quebec, eastern Canada, which is classified into two ecological regions, themselves subdivided into eastern (cool-wet) and western (warm-dry) sub regions. Clear-cutting triggered successional setbacks in half of these regions. Such setbacks could prolong, by at least an additional century, the expected time to compositional recovery after clear-cutting. To prevent the overestimation of allowable cuts of economically important late-successional species, foresters could monitor post-clear-cut successional trajectories to assess whether setbacks were triggered. Post-clear-cut successional setbacks occurred in the two western ecological regions where climatic conditions are warmer and drier than in their eastern counterpart where no setbacks occurred. Hence, sustainability issues brought on by successional setbacks may be exacerbated by climate change. Finally, furthering our understanding of the transformation of successional dynamics by anthropogenic disturbances will be essential to insure sustainable forestry practices.},

We simultaneously collected spatially explicit data on predator and prey to investigate acute responses of a threatened forest ungulate, the boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus), to the spatiotemporal dynamics of wolf (Canis lupus) distribution during spring. Movement analysis of GPS-collared individuals from both species revealed high plasticity in habitat-selection decisions of caribou. Female caribou avoided open areas and deciduous forests and moved relatively fast and toward foraging areas when wolves were closer than 2.5 km. Caribou also avoided food-rich areas only when wolves were within 1 km. Our results bridge the gap between long-term perceived risk and immediate flight responses by revealing dynamic antipredator tactics in response to predator proximity.},

For instance, how will climate change alter complex, multi-species relationships that are modulated by climatic variation and that underlie ecosystem-level processes? Caribou (Rangifer tarandus), a keystone species in Newfoundland, Canada, provides a useful model for unravelling potential and complex long-term implications of climate change on biotic interactions and population change. We measured cause-specific caribou calf predation (1990{\textendash}2013) in Newfoundland relative to seasonal weather patterns. We show that black bear (Ursus americanus) predation is facilitated by time-lagged higher summer growing degree days, whereas coyote (Canis latrans) predation increases with current precipitation and winter temperature. Based on future climate forecasts for the region, we illustrate that, through time, coyote predation on caribou calves could become increasingly important, whereas the influence of black bear would remain unchanged. From these predictions, demographic projections for caribou suggest long-term population limitation specifically through indirect effects of climate change on calf predation rates by coyotes. While our work assumes limited impact of climate change on other processes, it illustrates the range of impact that climate change can have on predator{\textendash}prey interactions. We conclude that future efforts to predict potential effects of climate change on populations and ecosystems should include assessment of both direct and indirect effects, including climate{\textendash}predator interactions.},

  abstract = {The functional response is at the core of any predator-prey interactions as it establishes the link between trophic levels. The use of inaccurate functional response can profoundly affect the outcomes of population and community models. Yet most functional responses are evaluated using phenomenological models which often fail to discriminate among functional response shapes and cannot identify the proximate mechanisms regulating predator acquisition rates. Using a combination of behavioral, demographic, and experimental data collected over 20 years, we develop a mechanistic model based on species traits and behavior to assess the functional response of a generalist mammalian predator, the arctic fox (               Vulpes lagopus               ), to various tundra prey species (lemmings and the nests of geese, passerines, and sandpipers). Predator acquisition rates derived from the mechanistic model were consistent with field observations. Although acquisition rates slightly decrease at high goose nest and lemming densities, none of our simulations resulted in a saturating response in all prey species. Our results highlight the importance of predator searching components in predator-prey interactions, especially predator speed, while predator acquisition rates were not limited by handling processes. By combining theory with field observations, our study provides support that the predator acquisition rate is not systematically limited at the highest prey densities observed in a natural system. Our study also illustrates how mechanistic models based on empirical estimates of the main components of predation can generate functional response shapes specific to the range of prey densities observed in the wild. Such models are needed to fully untangle proximate drivers of predator-prey population dynamics and to improve our understanding of predator-mediated interactions in natural communities.},

  abstract = {Determining habitat quality for wildlife populations requires relating a species' habitat to its survival and reproduction. Within a season, species occurrence and density can be disconnected from measures of habitat quality when resources are highly seasonal, unpredictable over time, and patchy. Here we establish an explicit link among dynamic selection of changing resources, spatio-temporal species distributions, and fitness for predictive abundance and occurrence models that are used for short-term water management and long-term restoration planning. We used the wading bird distribution and evaluation models (WADEM) that estimate (1) daily changes in selection across resource gradients, (2) landscape abundance of flocks and individuals, (3) conspecific foraging aggregation, and (4) resource unit occurrence (at fixed 400~m cells) to quantify habitat quality and its consequences on reproduction for wetland indicator species. We linked maximum annual numbers of nests detected across the study area and nesting success of Great Egrets (Ardea alba), White Ibises (Eudocimus albus), and Wood Storks (Mycteria americana) over a 20-year period to estimated daily dynamics of food resources produced by WADEM over a 7490~km2 area. For all species, increases in predicted species abundance in March and high abundance in April were strongly linked to breeding responses. Great Egret nesting effort and success were higher when birds also showed greater conspecific foraging aggregation. Synthesis and applications: This study provides the first empirical evidence that dynamic habitat selection processes and distributions of wading birds over environmental gradients are linked with reproductive measures over periods of decades. Further, predictor variables at a variety of temporal (daily-multiannual) resolutions and spatial (400~m to regional) scales effectively explained variation in ecological processes that change habitat quality. The process used here allows managers to develop short- and long-term conservation strategies that (1) consider flexible behavioral patterns and (2) are robust to environmental variation over time.},

Demographic models explicitly incorporate birth and death rates, and to varying degrees the processes that affect them, and are often used to evaluate population viability. Demographic models vary in complexity from deterministic matrix models of a single population to stochastic, spatially explicit individual-based models that keep track of each individual on specific landscapes. The population viability analysis tools are used to provide information that can, in turn, be used in either systematic conservation planning or to design landscapes. The examples of such use include setting minimum population or patch sizes for single species or multispecies systematic conservation planning, and parameterizing statistical approximation models.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present and analyze predator-prey system where prey population is linearly harvested and affected by fear and the prey population has grown logistically in the absence of predators. The predator population follows hunting cooperation, and it predates the prey population in the Holling type II functional responses. Based on those assumptions, a two-dimensional mathematical model is derived. The positivity, boundedness, and extinction of both prey and predator populations of the solution of the system are discussed. The existence, stability (local and global), and the Hopf bifurcation analysis of the biologically feasible equilibrium points are investigated. The aim of this research is to explore the effect of fear on the prey population and hunting cooperation on the predator population, and both prey and predator populations are harvested linearly and taken as control parameters of the model.

From the numerical simulation, it was found that the fear effect, hunting cooperation, prey harvesting, and predator harvesting change the dynamics of system 4.},

  abstract = {Theory states that both the spatial complexity of landscapes and the strength of interactions between consumers and their resources are important for maintaining biodiversity and the balance of nature. Spatial complexity is hypothesized to promote biodiversity by reducing the potential for competitive exclusion; whereas, models show that weak trophic interactions can enhance stability and maintain biodiversity by dampening destabilizing oscillations associated with strong interactions. Here, we show that spatial complexity can reduce the strength of consumer{\textendash}resource interactions in natural food webs. By sequentially aggregating food webs of individual aquatic habitat patches across a floodplain mosaic, we found that increasing spatial complexity resulted in decreases in the strength of interactions between predators and prey, owing to a greater proportion of weak interactions and a reduced proportion of strong interactions in the meta-food web. The main mechanism behind this pattern was that some patches provided predation refugia for species that were often strongly preyed upon in other patches. If weak trophic interactions do indeed promote stability, then our findings may signal an additional mechanism by which complexity and stability are linked in nature. In turn, this may have implications for how the values of landscape complexity, and the costs of biophysical homogenization, are assessed.},

Employing these various sets of data, we were able to determine the quantity of each food consumed by moose, the time required to acquire the foods, preferences for different food plants, and differences demonstrated by the sexes. In addition to this information, we collected data on the moose's ability to utilize each of the forage plants and the population densities of moose in different years (1972{\textendash}1974) in two forest types. This enabled us to examine energy flow within each of the populations and determine in what manner energy limits the moose population.},

This goal was consistent with a foraging strategy that maximized the intake of some nutritional component, i.e. energy, protein, etc. The optimization problem, however, was bounded. Three constraints appeared to limit the goal: body temperature must be maintained within set upper and lower limits, thermal equilibrium must be maintained over an extended period so the activity cycle strategy can be repeated and sufficient time must be spent ruminating.},

  abstract = {Flies (Diptera) damage ungulates far beyond the injury of their bite wounds: they are vectors of diseases and cause ungulates to lose foraging opportunities due to avoidance behaviour. We can use the behavioural and physiological responses of bison Bison spp. (Artiodactyla: Bovidae), caribou/reindeer Rangifer tarandus (Artiodactyla: Cervidae), and moose/elk Alces alces (Artiodactyla: Cervidae) to assess the impacts of flies on these ungulates. Ungulates rely on morphological and physiological resistance to flies at low intensities of exposure. However, as fly exposure increases, ungulates begin to react with behavioural avoidance in addition to increasing their physiological response. Rangifer tarandus are highly sensitive to flies and respond quickly to their presence by avoidance behaviours that incur fitness costs through reduced body mass. Alces alces are less reactive to fly exposure, enduring the presence of flies and maintaining a low loss of fitness, sometimes dying from the cumulative effects of exposure. Bison spp. may use a facultative strategy that depends upon the prevalence of flies and associated diseases in their environment. Among these strategies, variables such as the type of fly bite, presence and degree of infection, and heritability of resistance affect individual host survival. Relationships between flies and ungulates can integrate multiple scales of organisation in the ecosystem to reflect system stability. Climate change is predicted to alter the species composition and seasonal phenology of flies and the associated effects of wounding and vector-borne disease on ungulate populations that are central to the functions of Arctic and temperate ecosystems in the Northern Hemisphere.},

Eastern coyotes (Canis latrans) have \-ascended to the role of apex predator across much of eastern North America since the extirpation of wolves (Canis spp.) and there has been considerable confusion regarding their ability to prey on ungulates and their ecological niche relative to wolves. Eastern wolves (C. lycaon) are thought to have been the historical top predator in eastern deciduous forests and have previously been characterized as deer specialists that are inefficient predators of moose because of their smaller size relative to gray wolves (C. lupus). We investigated intrinsic and extrinsic influences on per capita kill rates of white-\-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and moose (Alces alces) during winter by sympatric packs of eastern coyotes, eastern wolves, and admixed canids in Ontario, Canada to clarify the predatory ability and ecological roles of the different canid top predators of eastern North America. Eastern coyote ancestry within packs negatively influenced per capita total ungulate (deer and moose combined) and moose kill rates. Furthermore, canids in packs dominated by eastern coyote ancestry consumed significantly less ungulate \-biomass and more anthropogenic food than packs dominated by wolf ancestry. Similar to gray wolves in previous studies, eastern wolves preyed on deer where they were available. However, in areas were deer were scarce, eastern wolves killed moose at rates similar to those previously documented for gray wolves at comparable moose densities across North America. Eastern coyotes are effective deer predators, but their dietary flexibility and low kill rates on moose suggest they have not replaced the ecological role of wolves in eastern North America.},

An unintended consequence is the strong modulation of the three-way interaction involving people, predators and prey, a dynamic that questions the extent to which animal distributions and interactions are independent of subtle human influences. Here, I capitalize on the remarkable 9-day synchronicity in which 90\% of moose neonates in the Yellowstone Ecosystem are born, to demonstrate a substantive change in how prey avoid predators; birth sites shift away from traffic-averse brown bears and towards paved roads. The decade-long modification was associated with carnivore recolonization, but neither mothers in bear-free areas nor non-parous females altered patterns of landscape use. These findings offer rigorous support that mammals use humans to shield against carnivores and raise the possibility that redistribution has occurred in other mammalian taxa due to human presence in ways we have yet to anticipate. To interpret ecologically functioning systems within parks, we must now also account for indirect anthropogenic effects on species distributions and behaviour.},

Caribou declined in the late 1930's and 1940's after moose (Alces alces) expanded their range and wolves (Canis lupus) increased. Following a wolf reduction program from 1949 to 1962, the caribou expanded until a high was reached in the late 1960's, after which the herds again diminished as wolf numbers increased and calf recruitment decreased. Three caribou populations were censused between 1976 and 1982, and an experiment was conducted on one of these areas (with the others as controls) to test the effect of wolf numbers on herd growth. The Spatsizi{\textendash}Lawyers and Level{\textendash}Kawdy populations inhabited ranges where wolf densities were near 9{\textendash}10wolves/1000\hspace{0.6em}km               2               ;Spatsizi{\textendash}Lawyers declined between 1977 and 1982(r\hspace{0.6em}=\hspace{0.6em}-0.13) and Level{\textendash}Kawdy declined between 1977 and 1982(r\hspace{0.6em}=\hspace{0.6em}-0.12).

None of the populations were heavily hunted; however, both declining populations had low calf survival with a mean of 55\% of the calves dying within the first 2 weeks of life. Calf survival increased significantly at the Horseranch in the 3 years that wolves were reduced. In conclusion, we believe that the Spatsizi{\textendash}Lawyers and Level{\textendash}Kawdy populations declined as a result of predation on calves and adults. Yet, if wolves are managed to provide stabilizing recruitments for caribou, it should be possible to dampen the natural fluctuations of caribou and wolves that are frequent in unperturbed systems and maintain higher numbers of both species.},

Issues arise with respect to goals and driving questions, methods and approaches, and placing results in the context of broader ecological theory. 2 Much confusion stems from lack of clarity about whether the questions posed relate to community-level patterns or to species dynamics, and to what authors actually mean by the term `interaction strength'. Here, we describe the various ways in which this term has been applied and discuss the implications of loose terminology and definition for the development of this field. 3 Of particular concern is the clear gap between theoretical and empirical investigations of interaction strengths and food web dynamics. The ecological community urgently needs to explore new ways to estimate biologically reasonable model coefficients from empirical data, such as foraging rates, body size, metabolic rate, biomass distribution and other species traits. 4 Combining numerical and analytical modelling approaches should allow exploration of the conditions under which different interaction strengths metrics are interchangeable with regard to relative magnitude, system responses, and species identity. 5 Finally, the prime focus on predator{\textendash}prey links in much of the research to date on interaction strengths in food webs has meant that the potential significance of non-trophic interactions, such as competition, facilitation and biotic disturbance, has been largely ignored by the food web community. Such interactions may be important dynamically and should be routinely included in future food web research programmes.},

Indicators of a biome shift will likely first be evident along the climatic margins of the boreal forest and include changes in vegetation productivity, mortality, and recruitment, as well as overall vegetation greenness. However, the extent to which a biome shift is already underway remains unclear because of the local nature of most field studies, sparsity of systematic ground-based ecological monitoring, and reliance on coarse resolution satellite observations. Here, we evaluated early indicators of a boreal forest biome shift using four decades of moderate resolution (30 m) satellite observations and biogeoclimatic spatial datasets. Specifically, we quantified interannual trends in annual maximum vegetation greenness using an ensemble of vegetation indices derived from Landsat observations at 100,000 sample sites in areas without signs of recent disturbance. We found vegetation greenness increased (greened) at 38 [29, 42] \% and 22 [15, 26] \% of sample sites from 1985 to 2019 and 2000 to 2019, whereas vegetation greenness decreased (browned) at 13 [9, 15] \% and 15 [13, 19] \% of sample sites during these respective periods [95\% Monte Carlo confidence intervals]. Greening was thus 3.0 [2.6, 3.5] and 1.5 [0.8, 2.0] times more common than browning and primarily occurred in cold sparsely treed areas with high soil nitrogen and moderate summer warming. Conversely, browning primarily occurred in the climatically warmest margins of both the boreal forest biome and major forest types (e.g., evergreen conifer forests), especially in densely treed areas where summers became warmer and drier. These macroecological trends reflect underlying shifts in vegetation productivity, mortality, and recruitment that are consistent with early stages of a boreal biome shift.},

Using albedo estimates based on MODIS imagery and incoming solar radiation for the period between 2000 and 2008 along with forest biomass estimates for eastern Canada, we have estimated that net radiative forcing for the conversion from closed-canopy coniferous forests to open lichen woodlands would be about -0.12nWm-2ha-1, and would therefore generate a cooling effect in the atmosphere. Based on current estimates of area in open lichen woodlands within the closed-canopy black spruce{\textendash}moss forests of eastern Canada, we estimate that a current net forcing of -0.094mWm-2 has already arisen from such conversions. As projections of future climate have been linked to increased probability of forest fires, the generation of open lichen woodlands provides a possible negative feedback to climate change. Results also suggest that carbon sequestration through the afforestation of boreal lichen woodlands may not provide a climate change mitigation benefit.},

  abstract = {(1) The theoretical distribution of non-omniscient predators in a heterogeneous multi-patch environment is studied by numerical simulation. Although various relative densities are explored, we mostly attend to environments where prey density is approximately one order of magnitude higher than predator density. (2) Predators are assumed to follow the rule of abandoning their current patch when local capture rate is lower than estimated capture rate in the environment as a whole. This rule was chosen because it is known to maximize long-term capture rate in many foraging situations. For convenience, we assume that after abandoning a patch, predators arrive at random at any patch in the environment. (3) Predators detect precisely the capture rate in their current patch but `learn' about the environmental average. Learning is simulated using a linear operator model which estimates global capture rate as a weighted average of past and current experienced capture rate. Following a common approach is psychological models of simple learning, the relative weight of past and present capture rate is controlled by a parameter denominated the `memory factor'. (4) In the absence of depletion, the predators distribute themselves close to the predictions of the Ideal Free Distribution model. This result indicates that the IFD prediction is not dependent on assuming omniscient predation, but instead can be jointly derived from reasonable assumptions about learning and optimal foraging at individual level. (5) When the environment depletes as a consequence of predation, cumulative prey mortality can be positively or negatively density-dependent, depending on the interaction between predator efficiency and the velocity of the learning process as determined by the memory factor. (6) The learning model converges towards the IFD faster than `omniscient' variants in which the predators, instead of using a learned estimate and migrating `blindly' to any patch, use the true environmental average for the migration decision and migrate only to patches with capture rate higher than their current capture rate. (7) Both spatial and temporal between-patch variance in prey density affect the behaviour of our model.},

While real-time and fully automated monitoring of the abiotic components of ecosystems has been possible for some time, monitoring the biotic components at different organizational scales, e.g. from individual behaviours and traits to the abundance and distribution of species, is far more challenging. Recent technological advancements offer potential solutions to achieve this through: (i) increasingly affordable high throughput recording hardware, which can collect rich multidimensional data, and (ii) increasingly accessible artificial intelligence approaches, which are able to extract ecological knowledge from large datasets. However, automating the monitoring of facets of ecological populations and communities via such technologies is still in its infancy, being primarily achieved at low spatiotemporal resolutions within specific stages of the monitoring workflow. Here, we review existing technologies for data recording and processing that enable automated monitoring of ecological communities. We then present novel frameworks that combine such technologies, forming fully automated pipelines to detect, track, classify, and count multiple species, and even record behavioural and morphological traits, at resolutions which have previously been impossible to achieve. Based on these rapidly developing technologies, we illustrate a solution to one of the greatest challenges in ecology and conservation: the ability to rapidly generate high resolution, multidimensional, and critically, standardized data across complex ecologies.},

Trophic interactions may be altered through climate-dependent changes in either predator food preferences or prey communities. Yet, climate change impacts on predator diet remain surprisingly poorly understood. We experimentally studied the consequences of 2{\textdegree}C warmer climatic conditions on the trophic niche of a generalist lizard predator. We used a system of semi-natural mesocosms housing a variety of invertebrate species and in which climatic conditions were manipulated. Lizards in warmer climatic conditions ate at a greater predatory to phytophagous invertebrate ratio and had smaller individual dietary breadths. These shifts mainly arose from direct impacts of climate on lizard diets rather than from changes in prey communities. Dietary changes were associated with negative changes in fitness-related traits (body condition, gut microbiota) and survival. We demonstrate that climate change alters trophic interactions through top-predator dietary shifts, which might disrupt eco-evolutionary dynamics.},

We investigated the hypothesis that cyclic lemming populations indirectly affect arctic-nesting greater snow geese (Anser caerulescens atlanticus L.) through the behavioural and numerical responses of shared predators. 2. The study took place on Bylot Island in the Canadian High Arctic during two lemming cycles. We recorded changes in foraging behaviour and activity rate of arctic foxes, parasitic jaegers, glaucous gulls and common ravens in a goose colony during one lemming cycle and we monitored denning activity of foxes for 7 years. We also evaluated the total response of predators (i.e. number of eggs depredated). 3. Arctic foxes were more successful in attacking lemmings than goose nests because predators were constrained by goose nest defence. Predators increased their foraging effort on goose eggs following a lemming decline. 4. Activity rates in Tbz,M0he goose colony varied 3.5-fold in arctic foxes and 4.8-fold in parasitic jaegers, and were highest 2 and 3 years after the lemming peak, respectively. The breeding output of arctic foxes appeared to be driven primarily by lemming numbers. 5. Predators consumed 19-88\% of the annual goose nesting production and egg predation intensity varied 2.7-fold, being lowest during peak lemming years. Arctic foxes and parasitic jaegers were the key predators generating marked annual variation in egg predation. 6. Our study provides strong support for short-term, positive indirect effects and long-term, negative indirect effects of lemming populations on arctic-nesting geese. The outcome between these opposing indirect effects is probably an apparent competition between rodents and many terrestrial arctic-nesting birds.},

Functional redundancy is hypothesized to promote ecological resilience and stability, as ecosystem function of communities with more redundant species (those that perform similar functions) should be buffered against the loss of individual species. While functional redundancy is being increasingly quantified, few studies have linked differences in redundancy across communities to ecological outcomes. We conducted a review and meta-analysis to determine whether empirical evidence supports the asserted link between functional redundancy and ecosystem stability and resilience. We reviewed 423 research articles and assembled a data set of 32 studies from 15 articles across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Overall, the mean correlation between functional redundancy and ecological stability/resilience was positive. The mean positive effect of functional redundancy was greater for studies in which redundancy was measured as species richness within functional groups (vs. metrics independent of species richness), but species richness itself was not correlated with effect size. The results of this meta-analysis indicate that functional redundancy may positively affect community stability and resilience to disturbance, but more empirical work is needed including more experimental studies, partitioning of richness and redundancy effects, and links to ecosystem functions.},

However, combined empirical study of biodiversity and multi-trophic food webs at a large spatial and temporal resolution has been prohibited by the lack of appropriate access to such data from natural systems. Here, we assessed biodiversity and food-web characteristics across a 700 km2 riverine network over seasons using environmental DNA. We found contrasting biodiversity patterns between major taxonomic groups. Local richness showed statistically significant, season-dependent increases and decreases towards downstream location within the catchment for fish and bacteria, respectively. Meanwhile, invertebrate richness remained spatially unchanged but varied across seasons. The structure of local food webs, such as link density and nestedness, also varied across space and time. However, these patterns did not necessarily mirror those observed for biodiversity and functional feeding characteristics. Our results suggest that biodiversity patterns and food-web dynamics are not directly scalable to each other even at the same spatial and temporal scales. In order to conserve species diversity as well as the functional trophic integrity of communities, patterns of biodiversity and food-web characteristics must thus be jointly studied.},

By using Briot-Bouquet transformation we transform the model into a system, where the extinction steady state is represented by up to three distinct steady states, whose existence is determined by the values of appropriate Lambert W functions. We investigate how stability of extinction and coexistence steady states is affected by the rate of predation, predator fecundity, and the parameter characterizing the strength of functional response. The results suggest that the extinction steady state can be stable for sufficiently high predation rate and for sufficiently small predator fecundity. Moreover, in certain parameter regimes, a stable extinction steady state can coexist with a stable prey-only equilibrium or with a stable coexistence equilibrium, and it is rather the initial conditions that determine whether prey and predator populations will be maintained at some steady level, or both of them will become extinct. Another possibility is for coexistence steady state to be unstable, in which case sustained periodic oscillations around it are observed. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate the behavior for all dynamical regimes, and in each case a corresponding phase plane of the transformed system is presented to show a correspondence with stable and unstable extinction steady state.},

Using evidence on abiotic conditions and biotic interactions at these migration sites, we aimed to identify migration pathways from northern temperate to boreal forests for species showing northward range expansion. Location Quebec, Canada. Taxon Trees of northern temperate/boreal forests. Methods Using past (1970{\textendash}1977) and recently updated (2003{\textendash}2015) forest inventories across 761,100 km2, we first quantified latitudinal shifts for saplings of eight tree species and investigated colonization events at migration sites. We used field evidence and a consensus modelling approach to determine environmental suitability and identify edaphic, climatic and disturbance conditions, as well as species co-occurrence patterns, characterizing recent colonization events. The results were interpreted in relation to novel species associations facilitating species migration in unsuitable landscapes. Results All species showed northward latitudinal shifts driven by increased recruitment and colonization northward. Colonization events occurred largely at historically unsuitable sites. Migration sites showed a shift towards humus types characteristic of the boreal forest and not typically found in the core range of most temperate species. Climatic conditions at migration sites were initially colder than at occupied sites, but warming suggests recent climatic suitability. A decrease in conifer basal area at migration sites following disturbances reduced priority effects that possibly constrained deciduous species establishment. Co-occurrence patterns pointed to deciduous species tolerant of boreal edaphic conditions, leading the way for other temperate species. Main conclusions Temperate tree species can recruit into sites typical of boreal forests, even under environmentally challenging conditions. Warming and disturbances open up the way for some novel species associations that in turn have the potential to facilitate the recruitment of temperate species into the boreal forest, revealing migration pathways.},

Compared to the carnivorous cat, modern-day dogs differ in several digestive and metabolic traits that appear to be more associated with omnivorous such as man, pigs and rats. This has led to the classification of dogs as omnivores, but the origin of these `omnivorous' traits has, hitherto, been left unexplained. We discuss the foraging ecology of wild wolves and calculate the nutrient profiles of fifty diets reported in the literature. Data on the feeding ecology of wolves indicate that wolves are true carnivores consuming a negligible amount of vegetal matter. Wolves can experience prolonged times of famine during low prey availability while, after a successful hunt, the intake of foods and nutrients can be excessive. As a result of a `feast and famine' lifestyle, wolves need to cope with a highly variable nutrient intake requiring an adaptable metabolism, which is still functional in our modern-day dogs. The nutritive characteristics of commercial foods differ in several aspects from the dog's closest free-living ancestor in terms of dietary nutrient profile and this may pose physiological and metabolic challenges. The present study provides new insights into dog nutrition and contributes to the ongoing optimisation of foods for pet dogs.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Despite an increasing number of studies highlighting the impacts of climate change on boreal species, the main factors that will drive changes in species assemblages remain ambiguous. We quantify two climate-induced pathways based on direct and indirect effects on species occupancy and assemblage dissimilarity under different harvest management scenarios. The direct climate effects illustrate immediate impact of climate variables while the indirect effects are reflected through the changes in land cover composition. To understand the main causes in assemblage dissimilarity, we analyze the regional and the latitudinal species assemblage dissimilarity by decomposing it into             balanced variation in species occupancy and occurrence             and             occupancy and occurrence gradient             . We develop empirical models to predict the distribution of more than 100 bird and beetle species in the C{\^o}te-Nord region of Qu{\'e}bec over the next century. Our results show the two pathways that are based on immediate and lagged climate change effects are complementary and alter biodiversity, mainly caused by balanced variation in species occupancy and occurrence. At the regional scale, both effects have an impact on decreasing the number of winning species. Yet, responses are much larger in magnitude under mixed climate effects (a mixture of direct and indirect effects). Regional assemblage dissimilarity reached 0.77 and 0.69 under mixed effects versus 0.09 and 0.10 under indirect effects for beetles and birds, respectively, between RCP8.5 and baseline climate scenarios when considering harvest. Therefore, inclusion of climatic variables considers aspects other than just those related to forest landscapes, such as life-cycle of animal species. Latitudinally, assemblage dissimilarity increased following the climate conditions pattern. Our analysis contributes to the understanding of how climate change alters biodiversity by reshaping community composition and highlights the importance of climate variables in biodiversity prediction.},

  abstract = {Habitat changes due to human exploitation of natural resources impact ecosystems worldwide, notably by causing pronounced changes in abiotic and biotic conditions, which modify biological diversity at the taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional levels. In forest ecosystems, logging is the main human disturbance impacting biodiversity. The interplay between forest harvesting and biodiversity varies, however, with climate change through complex relationships that remain poorly documented. Our aim was to study the expected long-term variations in the assemblage of bird and beetle communities following modifications in forest management under different climate change scenarios. We develop empirical models predicting the distribution of 104 animal species in eastern Canadian boreal forest over the next century. We predict that forest harvesting will alter the diversity of both taxa by increasing assemblage dissimilarity under all the studied climate scenarios, mainly due to species turnover. Regionally, an overall increase in occupancy probability is projected for bird species, whereas a decrease is predicted for beetles, a variation that could reflect differences in ecological traits between taxa. Our results further predict a decrease in the number of species that increase their occupancy after harvest under the most severe climatic scenario for both taxa. We anticipate that under severe climate change, increasing forest disturbance will modify species habitat associated with both young and old habitats.},

Using new information on the selectivity or avoidance of fire as a function of stand age and composition, we ran simple simulation models that consider the changes in the regional age matrices induced by fire and harvesting to project future burn rates. We also projected estimated future regional vulnerability of timber supply to fire by considering these new burn rates. The inclusion of age-related feedbacks would have a large impact on projected increases in burn rates, mostly in a very fire active zone under aggressive climate forcing. Projected burn rates would still increase, but would be 50\% less in 2100 than if projected without this biotic feedback in some zones. Negative feedbacks would be virtually nonexistent when potential burning rates are below 1\%, whereas realized burning rates would be lowered by more than a 0.5 percentage point when potential burning rates exceed 2.5\%. Including fire{\textendash}vegetation feedbacks had virtually no impact on total volume harvested. As fire burns more old-growth coniferous stands, slightly negative impacts were projected on conifer harvested almost everywhere. These results underline the need to incorporate fire{\textendash}vegetation feedbacks when projecting future burn rates.},

We used ordinations and spatial regressions to assess the contributions of parameters to species occurrence. Roads and cutovers were most abundant in the south, leading to an increased prevalence of deciduous forest. Mature coniferous forest, however, occurred most commonly in the north. Occurrence probabilities for moose and deer were greatest in the south, in close association with deciduous trees. Wolf occurrence was also greatest in the south, positively related to both deciduous forest and road density. Caribou occurrence, however, was positively related to mature coniferous forest and negatively related to both wolf occurrence and roads. Wolverine occurrence was negatively related to deciduous forest. Our surveys demonstrated distinct mammal communities in the northern and southern halves of our study area, a separation that appeared to be mediated by deciduous forest and roads.},

  abstract = {A resource selection function (RSF) is any model that yields values proportional to the probability of use of a resource unit. RSF models often are fitted using generalized linear models (GLMs) although a variety of statistical models might be used. Information criteria such as the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) are tools that can be useful for selecting a model from a set of biologically plausible candidates. Statistical inference procedures, such as the likelihood-ratio test, can be used to assess whether models deviate from random null models. But for most applications of RSF models, usefulness is evaluated by how well the model predicts the location of organisms on a landscape. Predictions from RSF models constructed using presence/absence (used/ unused) data can be evaluated using procedures developed for logistic regression, such as confusion matrices, Kappa statistics, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. However, RSF models estimated from presence/ available data create unique problems for evaluating model predictions. For presence/available models we propose a form of k -fold cross validation for evaluating prediction success. This involves calculating the correlation between RSF ranks and area-adjusted frequencies for a withheld sub-sample of data. A similar approach can be applied to evaluate predictive success for out-of-sample data. Not all RSF models are robust for application in different times or different places due to ecological and behavioral variation of the target organisms.},

However, few studies have accounted for the cumulative and interacting impacts of climate change on forest productivity and natural disturbances; even fewer have considered drought impacts when projecting wood supply. We modeled how disturbance- and drought-induced tree mortality will affect wood supply in three regions of Canada's boreal forest over a 200-year period under three climate-forcing scenarios. We project strong declines in overall aboveground biomass due to increases in mortality caused mainly by increased drought and wildfire, particularly in drier, western regions. Using two management strategies, we show that maintaining current long-term sustainable harvesting levels will be extremely challenging depending on the level of anthropogenic climate forcing. Increased wildfire activity under severe climate forcing will strongly decrease the availability of harvestable stands. In western areas that are already water-limited, harvesting levels will need to be low to remain sustainable. Our results show that Canada's future wood supply and sustainable forest management practices are highly vulnerable to changes in climate; hence adaptation actions are needed to lower these vulnerabilities.},

Existing methods have provided estimates of population-level predation rates, but they have not been able to estimate kill rates by individual bears until recently and the accuracy of these estimates was unknown. Our objectives were to evaluate whether collars equipped with video cameras would be able to record predation events by brown bears and provide useful estimates of ungulate kill rates. We fitted 17 brown bears in the Nelchina Basin of Alaska, USA, with Global Positioning System (GPS) collars equipped with cameras in the spring of 2011, 2012, and 2013. We retrieved the collars in late June of each year to download the video data and associated GPS locations. To compensate for incomplete sampling, we constructed a calf risk model from previous calf mortality studies and used it to predict total calf kills for each bear through the end of June. The camera collars documented kill rates considerably greater than previous estimates. Median handling times by bears were 40 min for caribou calves and 60 min for moose calves. These short handling times should be considered by future researchers when trying to evaluate kill detectability and when factoring calf mortality into population models. We demonstrate that this technology can be successfully applied in the field and provide recommendations on the video sampling intervals necessary to detect predation rates.},

  abstract = {Classic local stability theory predicts that complex ecological networks are unstable and are unlikely to persist despite empiricists' abundant documentation of such complexity in nature. This contradiction has puzzled biologists for decades. While some have explored how stability may be achieved in small modules of a few interacting species, rigorous demonstrations of how large complex and ecologically realistic networks dynamically persist remain scarce and inadequately understood. Here, we help fill this void by combining structural models of complex food webs with nonlinear bioenergetic models of population dynamics parameterized by biological rates that are allometrically scaled to populations' average body masses. Increasing predator{\textendash}prey body mass ratios increase population persistence up to a saturation level that is reached by invertebrate and ectotherm vertebrate predators when being 10 or 100 times larger than their prey respectively. These values are corroborated by empirical predator{\textendash}prey body mass ratios from a global data base. Moreover, negative effects of diversity (i.e. species richness) on stability (i.e. population persistence) become neutral or positive relationships at these empirical ratios. These results demonstrate that the predator{\textendash}prey body mass ratios found in nature may be key to enabling persistence of populations in complex food webs and stabilizing the diversity of natural ecosystems.},

Additionally, stored nutrients may aid seedlings in recovery from browse damage. High plant nutrient content may, however, deem seedlings more susceptible to ungulate browsing because of increased foliar protein content and, thus, nutritional value. Research examining the relationship between fertilization of forest trees and ungulate herbivory has been conducted almost exclusively in boreal and temperate zones of North America and Europe, and has produced two common themes. The first is that nearly all trials used broadcast application of fertilizer. This method supplies nutrients to both the target species and competing vegetation, resulting in significant increases in nutritional value for all potential forage. The second common theme is that there is a higher likelihood of browse for fertilized plants. Exceptions to this thread exist, however, because browse preference of fertilized seedlings is apparently species-specific due to differences among species in resource allocation. Palatability appears to interact with the production of plant chemical defenses (i.e., alkaloids, phenylpropanoids, terpenoids). Variations in plant mineral nutrition and secondary metabolite production can play a significant role determining forage preference; however, ungulates under starvation or stress will browse plants of high toxicity or low nutritional value to maintain fitness.},

  abstract = {Non-native species can alter ecosystem functions performed by native species often by displacing influential native species. However, little is known about how ecosystem functions may be modified by trait-mediated indirect effects of non-native species. Oysters and other reef-associated filter feeders enhance water quality by controlling nutrients and contaminants in many estuarine environments. However, this ecosystem service may be mitigated by predation, competition, or other species interactions, especially when such interactions involve non-native species that share little evolutionary history. We assessed trophic and other interference effects on the critical ecosystem service of water filtration in mesocosm experiments. In single-species trials, typical field densities of oysters (Crassostrea virginica) reduced water-column chlorophyll a more strongly than clams (Mercenaria mercenaria). The non-native filter-feeding reef crab Petrolisthes armatus did not draw down chlorophyll a. In multi-species treatments, oysters and clams combined additively to influence chlorophyll a drawdown. Petrolisthes did not affect net filtration when added to the bivalve-only treatments. Addition of the predatory mud crab Panopeus herbstii did not influence oyster feeding rates, but it did stop chlorophyll a drawdown by clams. However, when Petrolisthes was also added in with the clams, the clams filtered at their previously unadulterated rates, possibly because Petrolisthes drew the focus of predators or habituated the clams to crab stimuli. In sum, oysters were the most influential filter feeder, and neither predators nor competitors interfered with their net effect on water-column chlorophyll. In contrast, clams filtered less, but were more sensitive to predators as well as a facilitative buffering effect of Petrolisthes, illustrating that non-native species can indirectly affect an ecosystem service by aiding the performance of a native species.},

The same applies to models where the population is divided in stages rather than in age classes.In the same line, Hadjibiros (1975, 1976) studied a more general model, where the transition matrix corresponds to a population divided in stages of unequal duration, and where the time varying influences of the internal or external factors are included. This model offers the possibility of computer simulation of the population dynamics of a natural population represented by a demographic vector.Some kind of relationship is proposed between the general matrix model and the Lefkovitch matrix (Lefkovitch, 1964, 1965); the elements of which, obtained by regression techniques from census data, describe the biological dependance of a stage i at time t + 1 on a stage j at time t.},

Yet, our ability to draw general conclusions remains limited by focus on discipline-bound sectors of the full social-ecological system.

The people who are affected and those who provide resources are increasingly asking for evidence that interventions improve ecosystem services and human well-being. New research is needed that considers the full ensemble of processes and feedbacks, for a range of biophysical and social systems, to better understand and manage the dynamics of the relationship between humans and the ecosystems on which they rely.

  abstract = {Background Studies that attempt to measure shifts in species distributions often consider a single species in isolation. However, understanding changes in spatial overlap between predators and their prey might provide deeper insight into how species redistribution affects food web dynamics. Predator{\textendash}prey overlap metrics Here, we review a suite of 10 metrics [range overlap, area overlap, the local index of collocation (Pianka's O), Hurlbert's index, biomass-weighted overlap, asymmetrical alpha, Schoener's D, Bhattacharyya's coefficient, the global index of collocation and the AB ratio] that describe how two species overlap in space, using concepts such as binary co-occurrence, encounter rates, spatial niche similarity, spatial independence, geographical similarity and trophic transfer. We describe the specific ecological insights that can be gained using each overlap metric, in order to determine which is most appropriate for describing spatial predator{\textendash}prey interactions for different applications. Simulation and case study We use simulated predator and prey distributions to demonstrate how the 10 metrics respond to variation in three types of predator{\textendash}prey interactions: changing spatial overlap between predator and prey, changing predator population size and changing patterns of predator aggregation in response to prey density. We also apply these overlap metrics to a case study of a predatory fish (arrowtooth flounder, Atheresthes stomias) and its prey (juvenile walleye pollock, Gadus chalcogrammus) in the Eastern Bering Sea, AK, USA. We show how the metrics can be applied to understand spatial and temporal variation in the overlap of species distributions in this rapidly changing Arctic ecosystem. Conclusions Using both simulated and empirical data, we provide a roadmap for ecologists and other practitioners to select overlap metrics to describe particular aspects of spatial predator{\textendash}prey interactions. We outline a range of research and management applications for which each metric may be suited.},

  abstract = {Predator{\textendash}prey interactions can be influenced by habitat at different spatial scales. In seagrass systems, blade density can provide refugia for prey at fine scales, which are further embedded within broad-scale features such as variation in biotic (e.g., predator assemblages) and abiotic attributes (e.g., turbidity, salinity). Fine-scale effects of seagrass habitats on predator{\textendash}prey interactions involving invertebrates have been well studied while less is known about their effects on fish as prey. A field experiment was conducted in Tampa Bay, Florida, USA to examine and separate the effects of habitat across fine and broad scales on the relative predation rates of tethered pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides). Artificial seagrass units (ASUs) were used at three levels of blade density and deployed in different locations within the seascape. Predation rates on pinfish decreased with increasing seagrass blade density. The effects of blade density were consistent across locations, but overall mortality was higher in the lower Bay, where the water was less turbid, higher in salinity, and characterized by a different suite of predators compared to the mid Bay. Using controlled-laboratory experiments, it was found that pinfish reduced their activity levels in more turbid water as well as in response to the presence of a common predator in both clear and more turbid waters. Thus, predation rates were influenced by the combined effects of refugia (fine scale), variation in prey behavior (broad scale), and detection by predators (both scales). This study demonstrates the strong influence habitat can have at different spatial scales in mediating predator{\textendash}prey interactions of mobile species in estuarine environments.},

Such habitat alterations could be worsened by spruce budworm (SBW) outbreaks. Using 6201 vegetation plots from provincial inventories conducted after the last SBW outbreak (1968{\textendash}1992) in boreal forests of Qu{\'e}bec (Canada), we investigated the influence of SBW-caused tree defoliation and mortality on understory vegetation layers relevant to woodland caribou and its main predators. We found a positive association between severe outbreaks and the cover of most groups of understory plant species, especially in stands that were dominated by balsam fir before the outbreak, where a high canopy openness particularly benefited relatively fast-growing deciduous plants. Such increases in early successional vegetation could provide high-quality forage for moose, which is likely to promote higher wolf densities and increase predation pressure on caribou. SBW outbreaks may thus negatively affect woodland caribou by increasing predation risk, the main factor limiting caribou populations in managed forests. For the near future, we recommend updating the criteria used to define critical caribou habitat to consider the potential impacts of spruce budworm defoliation.},

Though shifts in prey dominance and predator resource use along environmental gradients are rather common, empirical evidence on the role of indirect prey{\textendash}prey interactions through shared predation particularly with increasing productivity, is still scarce. In an 8-week lake mesocosm experiment, we manipulated both the addition of inorganic nutrients and the presence of generalist fish predators (crucian carp, Carassius carassius L.), to test for the effects of indirect interactions through shared predation along a productivity gradient. We found that apparent mutualism (indirect positive interaction) between benthic and pelagic prey strongly affected short-term responses of aquatic food webs to increasing productivity in the presence of a generalist fish. Increasing productivity favoured the relative abundance of benthic prey, following trends in natural productive lake systems. This led to a shift in fish selectivity from pelagic to benthic prey driven by changes in fish behaviour, which resulted in apparent mutualism due to the lower and delayed top-down control of pelagic prey at increasing productivity. Our results show empirical evidence that the coupling of multiple production pathways can lead to strong indirect interactions through shared predation, whereby prey dynamics on short time-scales are highly dependent on the foraging behaviour of generalist predators. This mechanism may play an important role in short-term responses of food webs across environmental gradients.},

  abstract = {Prey-predator interaction is one of the most commonly observed relationships in ecosystem. In the study of prey-predator models, it is frequently assumed that the changes in population densities are only time-dependent and the dynamics is generally represented by coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations. In natural system, however, either prey or predator or both move from one place to another for various reasons. In such a case, their dynamic interaction depends both on time and space and requires coupled nonlinear partial differential equations for its dynamic representation. It is also well documented that prey refuges affect the interaction between prey and predator significantly. In this paper, we studied the dynamics of a diffusive prey-predator interaction with prey refuge and type III response function. We have considered both one and two dimensional diffusivity in the model system and presented different stability results under the assumptions that one or both species may be mobile or sedentary. Our results showed that the system may exhibit different spatiotemporal (non-Turing) patterns, like spiral waves, patchy structures, spot pattern, or even spatiotemporal chaos depending on the refuge availability and diffusion rate of species. Another interesting finding was that the dynamic complexity in a prey-predator model increases in case of mobile predator and sedentary prey compare to mobile prey and sedentary predator while refuge availability is varied.},

The study is accomplished with respect to an ecological parameter that quantifies the reproductive gain of predator and two epidemiological parameters which measure the force of infection and virulence of the disease. We show analytically that the interior equilibrium loses its stability through Hopf bifurcation in the absence of diffusion if the reproductive gain of predator crosses some threshold value. In case of diffusive system, it is shown that the interior equilibrium, which is otherwise stable, may lose its stability due to diffusion. Criteria for the occurrence of various types of instability, like Turing, Hopf-Turing and pure Hopf, associated with the PPP model are presented with illustrations. Our simulation results reveal that this diffusion-driven instability creates various spatio-temporal patterns, like spot, stripe, mixture of spots \& stripes and spiral patterns, depending upon the values of ecological and diffusion parameters. Turing instability and the corresponding patterns are also observed with the variation of two epidemiological parameters. Interestingly, the epidemiological parameters that measure the infection rate and virulence of the disease show opposite patterns with their increasing values.},

Shared enemies can also mediate non-reciprocal (-, 0) indirect effects, i.e. indirect amensalism, whenever one prey species is not affected by the presence of alternative prey. We review 34 studies on terrestrial and freshwater systems to evaluate the extent to which apparent competition has been perceived as a reciprocal (-, -) or non-reciprocal (-, 0) interaction. We found only three studies showing reciprocal effects between apparent competitors. Indirect amensalism was documented in 10 studies and could be inferred for 16 other cases (76\% in total). The remaining five studies provided insufficient data to determine the form of indirect interaction. The apparent prevalence of non-reciprocal enemy-mediated interactions resembles that observed for resource-based interspecific competition. Amensal indirect effects via shared predation may result from differences in population size, nutritional value, susceptibility to attack, or asynchronous dynamics of alternative prey, or the predator's feeding preferences. Moreover, experimental protocols may confound the actual form of apparent competition through short-term observations, incomplete designs, or biased consideration of conspicuous interactions, leading to reciprocal effects being overlooked. We conclude that, at present, it is still difficult to determine the relative role of apparent competition vs indirect amensalism in natural food webs because most published studies have failed to document in full interactions via shared enemies.},

Despite storing nearly half of global forest carbon, the boreal biome of diverse forest types and ages is a poorly understood component of the carbon cycle. Using data from 871 permanent plots in the western boreal forest of Canada, we examined net annual aboveground biomass change ({$\Delta$}AGB) of four major forest types between 1958 and 2011. We found that {$\Delta$}AGB was higher for deciduous broadleaf (DEC) (1.44 Mg ha-1 year-1, 95\% Bayesian confidence interval (CI), 1.22{\textendash}1.68) and early-successional coniferous forests (ESC) (1.42, CI, 1.30{\textendash}1.56) than mixed forests (MIX) (0.80, CI, 0.50{\textendash}1.11) and late-successional coniferous (LSC) forests (0.62, CI, 0.39{\textendash}0.88). {$\Delta$}AGB declined with forest age as well as calendar year. After accounting for the effects of forest age, {$\Delta$}AGB declined by 0.035, 0.021, 0.032 and 0.069 Mg ha-1 year-1 per calendar year in DEC, ESC, MIX and LSC forests, respectively. The {$\Delta$}AGB declines resulted from increased tree mortality and reduced growth in all forest types except DEC, in which a large biomass loss from mortality was accompanied with a small increase in growth. With every degree of annual temperature increase, {$\Delta$}AGB decreased by 1.00, 0.20, 0.55 and 1.07 Mg ha-1 year-1 in DEC, ESC, MIX and LSC forests, respectively. With every cm decrease of annual climatic moisture availability, {$\Delta$}AGB decreased 0.030, 0.045 and 0.17 Mg ha-1 year-1 in ESC, MIX and LSC forests, but changed little in DEC forests. Our results suggest that persistent warming and decreasing water availability have profound negative effects on forest biomass in the boreal forests of western Canada. Furthermore, our results indicate that forest responses to climate change are strongly dependent on forest composition with late-successional coniferous forests being most vulnerable to climate changes in terms of aboveground biomass.},

The existence of the codimension-two Turing{\textendash}Hopf bifurcation point is proved, so that both the Turing and Hopf bifurcations will occur simultaneously. Then, through the global Hopf bifurcation results, the global Hopf bifurcation of the ratio-dependent predator-prey model is investigated when diffusion is absent. Further, to identify the spatiotemporal dynamics during the Turing{\textendash}Hopf bifurcation, the method of the multiple time scale analysis is employed to derive the amplitude equations near the codimension-two bifurcation point, instead of employing the center manifold theory and the normal form reduction. By analyzing the amplitude equations, it is found that the original ratio-dependent predator-prey model may exhibit the spatial, temporal or the spatiotemporal patterns, such as the nonconstant steady state, spatially homogeneous periodic solutions as well as the spatially inhomogeneous periodic solutions. Numerical simulations are carried out to validate the theoretical results.},

According to the literature, moose regularly reject non-browse forages offered in captivity, which may indirectly lead to an overproportional ingestion of easily digestible feeds and thus chronic acidosis, which may in turn be the cause of their low life expectancy in captivity. By feeding experiments in four animals, this study aimed at testing whether maintaining moose on roughage-only diets appears feasible. The diets used consisted of the typical zoo ration with mixed feeds (including alfalfa hay), and exclusive diets of alfalfa hay, combinations of alfalfa hay and grass hay, alfalfa hay and grass hay and dried browse leaves, and dried browse leaves only. Whereas results confirmed that moose do not ingest grass hay in relevant amounts, digestible energy (DE) intake on alfalfa hay was, at 0.67 {$\pm$} 0.15 DE MJ kg(-0.75) day(-1), above the estimated maintenance requirement of 0.6, and higher on the browse diets. At least for short-time periods, results contradict previous reports in the literature that alfalfa hay only is not a suitable maintenance diet for moose. At the same time the results promote feeding moose in captivity forage-based diets.},

It occurs as a result of environmental variation in abiotic factors and/or biotic factors structuring the spatial distribution of populations. However the ways in which abiotic and biotic factors interact to determine the existence and nature of spatial patterns in population density remain poorly understood. Here we present a new approach to studying this question by analysing a predator{\textendash}prey patch-model in a heterogenous landscape. We use analytical and numerical methods originally developed for studying nearest-neighbour (juxtacrine) signalling in epithelia to explore whether and under which conditions patterns emerge. We find that abiotic and biotic factors interact to promote pattern formation. In fact, we find a rich and highly complex array of coexisting stable patterns, located within an enormous number of unstable patterns. Our simulation results indicate that many of the stable patterns have appreciable basins of attraction, making them significant in applications. We are able to identify mechanisms for these patterns based on the classical ideas of long-range inhibition and short-range activation, whereby landscape heterogeneity can modulate the spatial scales at which these processes operate to structure the populations.},

Though once widely distributed in open habitats throughout the continent, the species' current distribution is significantly reduced, especially in the southern part of its range. Species distribution models are useful tools that can reveal the causes contributing to the decline of the species, especially in the southern limit of its global distribution. In this paper, we compared the maned wolf distribution, from known localities for the species, with a set of predictor variables: spatial (longitude and latitude), topo-climatic, land cover and anthropogenic. We modeled the distribution range using favorability function models that combine the probability of the occurrence of an event with the probability of that event occurring at random. We detected that the most favorable areas for the presence of the maned wolf are concentrated in southeastern and central Brazil, south of Paraguay and northeastern Argentina. Our results point to a central distribution nucleus of more favorable conditions for the species, from which it may have dispersed into intermediate or low favorable areas as found in the southernmost part of its range. Spatial models are useful in highlighting which factors affect the distribution of the maned wolf in South America, and use these results to guide conservation measures to be taken to improve its status.},

  abstract = {Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), a threatened species in Canada, inhabit landscapes dominated by mature and over-mature coniferous stands and tend to avoid areas used by other cervids, wolves (Canis lupus), and humans. We hypothesized that habitat modifications through logging and forest fire alter the space-use pattern of woodland caribou and result ultimately in lowered density. To test this hypothesis, density, distribution, space-use patterns, and mortality of caribou in disturbed landscapes (DLs) and undisturbed landscapes (ULs) of central Qu{\'e}bec were quantified by a systematic aerial survey (42 539 km2) and telemetry of 68 adult caribou females. A ground survey of terrestrial and arboreal lichens was carried out to estimate production of lichens in DLs and ULs. Three populations that occupied between 10 000 and 15 000 km2 were identified in the study area. Caribou abundance was not limited by intraspecific competition for food. Production of terrestrial lichens was estimated to support 3 to 4 times the surveyed caribou density (1.2{\textendash}2.1{\textendash}100 km-2). Pregnancy rate was almost 100\%, indicating that females were not food-limited. Space-use patterns were affected by forest disturbance. In DLs, caribou increased home range sizes and reduced fidelity to seasonal and annual home ranges, probably to avoid disturbed habitats. In response, the probability of surviving decreased with the extent of DL within home ranges. To help keep direct and indirect sources of caribou mortality at very low levels, forest management strategies should be oriented toward the protection of large interconnected blocks of forest to favour caribou spacing away from humans and predators and to maintain adequate space-use strategies.},

  abstract = {Limiting factors of caribou (Rangifer tarandus) populations vary regionally. In tundra environments, this species appears to be regulated by food, either because wolves (Canis lupus) are absent or because migration of caribou allows escape from predation during part of the year. In the boreal forest, the main limiting factors are hunting and predation but because of low caribou densities, no regulation mechanism seems to exist between caribou and wolves. Moose (Alces alces) is the primary prey species of wolves and consequently, if moose abundance increases, wolves should also increase, independently of the caribou population. Thus, caribou could experience high predation rates and be eliminated in high wolf densities. Here we attempted to identify the necessary conditions to maintain caribou numbers in the presence of moose. To do so, we built a deterministic model that simulated the relationship between a caribou population regulated by food competition and limited by predation, a moose population regulated by predation, and a wolf population, the abundance of which is determined by moose abundance. At current hunting rates for caribou and moose in the boreal forest, and in the absence of wolf trapping, the model predicted that the caribou population would be extirpated in approximately 100 years. Wolf trapping was not adequate to conserve the caribou population unless very intensive control was undertaken. In the absence of trapping, cessation of caribou hunting allowed a 3-fold increase in caribou numbers over the long term, if the moose population remained low. According to our model, the best management measure for caribou consisted of maintaining a low moose density through appropriate population and habitat management strategies, which prevented expansion of the wolf population and limited predation on caribou.},

We were able to list 197 plant taxa negatively affected by the three cervid species, as opposed to 24 that benefited from their herbivory. The plant taxa negatively affected by caribou/reindeer (19), moose (37), and white-tailed deer (141) comprised 5\%, 9\%, and 11\% of vascular plants present in their respective ranges. Each cervid affected mostly species eaten during the growing season: lichens and woody species for caribou/reindeer, woody species and aquatics for moose, and herbs and woody species for white-tailed deer. White-tailed deer were the only deer reported to feed on threatened or endangered plants. Studies related to damage caused by caribou/reindeer were scarce and often concerned lichens. Most reports for moose and white-tailed deer came from areas where wolves were absent or rare. Among the three cervids, whitetailed deer might damage the most vegetation because of its smaller size and preference for herbs.},

Managers must consider the indirect effects of forest operations on caribou through their impacts on caribou mortality factors, such as predation. Lichens remain important. Habitat destruction may in some cases be the ultimate cause of population decline. Reactions of caribou to disturbance vary, and remain controversial; more research is needed. Multiple resource managers of boreal commercial forests should identify sensitive components of caribou range - calving grounds, rutting locations, wintering areas, and travel routes among them - and prescribe for these areas in forest management plans. Ways of accommodating caribou in commercial forests are not well established, but some examples suggest how this might be done. Most importantly, areas that have been proven by their continued use to contain all necessary requirements for caribou survival should not be physically altered until their essential qualities and functions are better understood.},

The nodes may have qualitative and quantitative characteristics, and the edges may have properties such as weights and directions. Graph theory provides a flexible conceptual model that can clarify the relationship between structures and processes, including the mechanisms of configuration effects and compositional differences. Graph concepts apply to many ecological and evolutionary phenomena, including interspecific associations, spatial structure, dispersal in landscapes, and relationships within metapopulations and metacommunities. We review applications of graph theory in biology, emphasizing graphs with spatial contexts. We show how spatial graph properties can be used for description and comparison as well as to test specific hypotheses. We suggest that future applications should include explicit spatial elements for landscape studies of ecological, genetic and epidemiological phenomena.},

  abstract = {Multi-scale resource selection modeling is used to identify factors that limit species distributions across scales of space and time. This multi-scale nature of habitat suitability complicates the translation of inferences to single, spatial depictions of habitat required for conservation of species. We estimated resource selection functions (RSFs) across three scales for a threatened ungulate, woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), with two objectives: (1) to infer the relative effects of two forms of anthropogenic disturbance (forestry and linear features) on woodland caribou distributions at multiple scales and (2) to estimate scale-integrated resource selection functions (SRSFs) that synthesize results across scales for management-oriented habitat suitability mapping. We found a previously undocumented scale-specific switch in woodland caribou response to two forms of anthropogenic disturbance. Caribou avoided forestry cut-blocks at broad scales according to first- and second-order RSFs and avoided linear features at fine scales according to third-order RSFs, corroborating predictions developed according to predator-mediated effects of each disturbance type. Additionally, a single SRSF validated as well as each of three single-scale RSFs when estimating habitat suitability across three different spatial scales of prediction. We demonstrate that a single SRSF can be applied to predict relative habitat suitability at both local and landscape scales in support of critical habitat identification and species recovery.},

  abstract = {As global climate change progresses, wildlife management will benefit from knowledge of demographic responses to climatic variation, particularly for species already endangered by other stressors. In Canada, climate change is expected to increasingly impact populations of threatened woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) and much focus has been placed on how a warming climate has potentially facilitated the northward expansion of apparent competitors and novel predators. Climate change, however, may also exert more direct effects on caribou populations that are not mediated by predation. These effects include meteorological changes that influence resource availability and energy expenditure. Research on other ungulates suggests that climatic variation may have minimal impact on low-density populations such as woodland caribou because per-capita resources may remain sufficient even in "bad" years. We evaluated this prediction using demographic data from 21 populations in western Canada that were monitored for various intervals between 1994 and 2015. We specifically assessed whether juvenile recruitment and adult female survival were correlated with annual variation in meteorological metrics and plant phenology. Against expectations, we found that both vital rates appeared to be influenced by annual climatic variation. Juvenile recruitment was primarily correlated with variation in phenological conditions in the year prior to birth. Adult female survival was more strongly correlated with meteorological conditions and declined during colder, more variable winters. These responses may be influenced by the life history of woodland caribou, which reside in low-productivity refugia where small climatic changes may result in changes to resources that are sufficient to elicit strong demographic effects. Across all models, explained variation in vital rates was low, suggesting that other factors had greater influence on caribou demography. Nonetheless, given the declining trajectories of many woodland caribou populations, our results highlight the increased relevance of recovery actions when adverse climatic conditions are likely to negatively affect caribou demography.},

  abstract = {Conservation strategies for imperiled species are frequently based on identifying and addressing the probable causes of population decline, an approach known as the declining population paradigm. Causes, however, are frequently linked to demographic outcomes by multiple mechanisms, and failing to target the primary mechanisms can reduce the effectiveness and efficiency of conservation actions. Increasingly, conservation strategies also need to consider emerging threats, such as climate change. Here, we use boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), a threatened ecotype of woodland caribou, as a case study to illustrate how landscape disturbance and climate change can each exert negative demographic effects on caribou through multiple and complex mechanisms. We reviewed the extensive literature focused on woodland caribou to identify and assess the relative importance of each putative mechanism. While disturbance-mediated apparent competition, the expansion of novel predators, and altered predator behavior appear to be primary mechanisms dictating past and current declines of caribou, climate change has increasing potential to exert strong direct and indirect effects now and in the future. Predicted climate effects may prevent some populations from regaining self-sustaining status, despite local conservation actions. Our review revealed several knowledge gaps, notably a lack of clarity on the spatial extent of undisturbed habitat required for caribou populations to be stable. We used outcomes from our review to demonstrate how a mechanistic understanding of population decline can inform habitat-based conservation strategies for caribou. For populations residing within highly disturbed ranges, habitat restoration is a key recommendation of current conservation strategies, yet the large spatial extent of disturbances will require prioritization of areas for restoration. Maximizing the conservation return-on-investment for caribou will require a mechanistically informed prioritization process that targets conservation actions toward the primary mechanisms underlying population decline.},

From biological systems to environmental modifications, from quantum fields to high energy collisions, or from the number of contacts one person has, on average, to the flux of vehicles in the streets of urban centres, all these complex, non-linear problems are better understood under the light of the scale-free network's properties. A few mechanisms have been found to explain the emergence of scale invariance in complex networks. Here we discuss a mechanism based on how information is locally spread among agents in a scale-free network. We show that the correct description of the information dynamics is given in terms of the q-exponential function, with the power-law behaviour arising in the asymptotic limit. This result shows that the best statistical approach to the information dynamics is given by Tsallis Statistics. We discuss the main properties of the information spreading process in the network and analyse the role and behaviour of some of the parameters as the number of agents increases. The different mechanisms for optimization of the information spread are discussed.},

Lichens colonize almost every substrate in nature and play an important role in the visual appearance of a natural object. The propagation of lichens over the substrate is performed by an Open Diffusion Limited Aggregation model constrained by the characteristics of the environment. The designer can control the development of lichens with simple parameters. Rendering the complex geometry and texture of lichens is achieved by instantiating three dimensional lichen models stored in an atlas of shapes created after real world images. The lichens obtained by our approach considerably increase the realism of complex natural scenes.

Examples include, but are not limited to, flexible Bayesian approaches (e.g. BUGS, stan), frequentist and likelihood-based approaches (e.g. packages lme4) and machine learning methods. These software and programs afford the user greater control and flexibility in tailoring complex hierarchical models. However, this level of control and flexibility places a higher degree of responsibility on the user to evaluate the robustness of their statistical inference. To determine how often biologists are running model diagnostics on hierarchical models, we reviewed 50 recently published papers in 2021 in the journal Nature Ecology \& Evolution, and we found that the majority of published papers did not report any validation of their hierarchical models, making it difficult for the reader to assess the robustness of their inference. This lack of reporting likely stems from a lack of standardized guidance for best practices and standard methods. Here, we provide a guide to understanding and validating complex models using data simulations. To determine how often biologists use data simulation techniques, we also reviewed 50 recently published papers in 2021 in the journal Methods Ecology \& Evolution. We found that 78\% of the papers that proposed a new estimation technique, package or model used simulations or generated data in some capacity (18 of 23 papers); but very few of those papers (5 of 23 papers) included either a demonstration that the code could recover realistic estimates for a dataset with known parameters or a demonstration of the statistical properties of the approach. To distil the variety of simulations techniques and their uses, we provide a taxonomy of simulation studies based on the intended inference. We also encourage authors to include a basic validation study whenever novel statistical models are used, which in general, is easy to implement. Simulating data helps a researcher gain a deeper understanding of the models and their assumptions and establish the reliability of their estimation approaches. Wider adoption of data simulations by biologists can improve statistical inference, reliability and open science practices.},

  abstract = {Studying the diet of an apex predator such as the wolf (Canis lupus L.) is important for revealing the relationships between this species and its ungulate prey. Between April and September, a total of 50 wolf scats were collected for two consecutive years (2018 and 2019) in the Osogovo Mountains (n= 26 for 2018 and n=24 for 2019). The comparison between the two years shows that in 2018 the wolf consumed only larger species - wild boar (Sus scrofa L.) (53.8\%) and domestic horse (Equus ferus caballus L.) (46.2\%), the latter being eaten mainly as carrion due to the harsh winter. In 2019 the wild boar dominated in the food spectrum (80.8\%), as the other species, such the domestic horse and the roe deer (Capreolus capreolus L.) are represented less (11.5\% and 3.8\% respectively). The lower content of domestic horse remains may be explained by the increased care which the free ranging horses have received over the considered period. The results from a previous survey (conducted in 2005) in the same area showed that the roe deer accounted for a much higher proportion {\textendash} 71.9\% in the wolf's diet. The decline in the wolf's preferences for roe deer, as well as the increase in the percentage of higher-mass species in their food over the years may be due to the increasing number of wolves in the region. They consequently form larger packs with higher energy demand. This assumption is confirmed by the official game census. Despite the fact that a recent camera trap study in the same region indicates a higher density of roe deer (3.08-3.22 ind./km2) compared to the wild boar (0.82-0.90 ind./km2), the roe deer with its smaller average mass provides less energy per hunting effort for the wolf.},

The results showed that the wild boar was the most preferred prey by the wolf, complemented by the domestic horse. The roe deer had a smaller, close to insignificant share. The selectivity index also confirmed the wild boar dominance in the wolf diet, which was consistent through the years and seasons. The active selection towards wild boar was anti-apostatic in nature as the wild boar densities were 10-times lower than those of the roe deer. Our results differed from those obtained by a previous study in the same region in 2002-2003, where the roe deer accounted for 71.9\% of the wolf diet.

  abstract = {Regulation of emotions is generally associated exclusively with the brain. However, there is evidence that peripheral systems are also involved in mood, stress vulnerability vs. resilience, and emotion-related memory encoding. Prevalence of stress and mood disorders such as major depression, bipolar disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder is increasing in our modern societies. Unfortunately, 30\%-50\% of individuals respond poorly to currently available treatments highlighting the need to further investigate emotion-related biology to gain mechanistic insights that could lead to innovative therapies. Here, we provide an overview of inflammation-related mechanisms involved in mood regulation and stress responses discovered using animal models. If clinical studies are available, we discuss translational value of these findings including limitations. Neuroimmune mechanisms of depression and maladaptive stress responses have been receiving increasing attention, and thus, the first part is centered on inflammation and dysregulation of brain and circulating cytokines in stress and mood disorders. Next, recent studies supporting a role for inflammation-driven leakiness of the blood-brain and gut barriers in emotion regulation and mood are highlighted. Stress-induced exacerbated inflammation fragilizes these barriers which become hyperpermeable through loss of integrity and altered biology. At the gut level, this could be associated with dysbiosis, an imbalance in microbial communities, and alteration of the gut-brain axis which is central to production of mood-related neurotransmitter serotonin. Novel therapeutic approaches such as anti-inflammatory drugs, the fast-acting antidepressant ketamine, and probiotics could directly act on the mechanisms described here improving mood disorder-associated symptomatology. Discovery of biomarkers has been a challenging quest in psychiatry, and we end by listing promising targets worth further investigation.},

We assess the focal or 'umbrella' value of the boreal population of woodland caribou for conservation of mammalian and avian richness (n = 432) in the boreal region of Canada by (i) evaluating co-occurrence of caribou distribution with that of boreal mammals (n = 102), birds (n = 330), at-risk mammals (n = 11) and at-risk birds (n = 47); and (ii) conducting systematic conservation planning using MARXAN software to identify minimum representative and complementary reserve networks, comprised of planning units deemed large enough (10,000 km 2) for persistence of terrestrial wildlife, both at the extent of boreal caribou distribution and the entire boreal region. While boreal caribou overlap with the range of 90\% of boreal birds and mammals, area-efficient networks representative of boreal diversity focus on species-rich areas south of caribou distribution and other areas that contain relatively small-ranged species. A similar pattern occurs when the MARXAN analysis focused only on caribou distribution, i.e. representative networks are preferentially located on southern herd ranges. However, this situation differs markedly to include large areas within the distribution of caribou if anthropogenic footprint on the landscape is considered as a constraint on reserve design. Efforts to sustain boreal caribou offer considerable opportunities to conserve diversity of co-occurring mammals and birds, including areas of the relatively more disturbed caribou southern ranges that have irreplaceable value in an efficient and representative pan-boreal network of reserves. The high focal value of boreal caribou for animal diversity should be considered when making decisions and policy choices about how to best allocate conservation efforts across its extensive distribution.},

  abstract = {1. Changes in one prey species' density can indirectly affect the abundance of another prey species if a shared predator eats both species. Sometimes, indirect effects occur when prey straddle habitats, including when riparian predator populations grow in response to emergent aquatic insects and increase predation on terrestrial prey. However, predators may largely switch to aquatic insects or become satiated, reducing predation on terrestrial prey. 2. To determine the net indirect effect of aquatic insects on terrestrial arthropods via generalist spider predators, a field experiment was conducted mimicking midge influx and a wolf spider numerical response inside enclosures near an Icelandic lake. Lab mesocosms were also used to assess per capita rates of spider predation u nder differing levels of midge abundance. 3. Midges always decreased sentinel prey predation, but this effect increased with predator density. When midges were absent, predation increased 30\% at a high spider density, but predation was equal between spider treatments when midges were present. In situ arthropods showed no effect of midge or spider treatments, although non-significant abundance patterns were observed congruent with sentinel prey results. 4. In lab mesocosms, prey survivorship increased {$\geq$}50\% where midges were present and rapidly saturated; the addition of 5, 20, 50, and 100 midges equivalently reduced spider predation, supporting predator distraction rather than satiation as the root cause. 5. The present results demonstrate a strong positive indirect effect of midges and broadly support the concept that predator responses to alternative prey are a major influence on the magnitude and direction of predator-mediated indirect effects.},

  abstract = {Indirect interactions are widespread among prey species that share a common predator, but the underlying mechanisms driving these interactions are often unclear, and our ability to predict their outcome is limited. Changes in behavioural traits that impact predator space use could be a key proximal mechanism mediating indirect interactions, but there is little empirical evidence of the causes and consequences of such behavioural-numerical response in multispecies systems. Here, we investigate the complex ecological relationships between seven prey species sharing a common predator. We used a path analysis approach on a comprehensive 9-year data set simultaneously tracking predator space use, prey densities and prey mortality rate on key species of a simplified Arctic food web. We show that high availability of a clumped and spatially predictable prey (goose eggs) leads to a twofold reduction in predator (arctic fox) home range size, which increases local predator density and strongly decreases nest survival of an incidental prey (American golden plover). On the contrary, a scattered cyclic prey with potentially lower spatial predictability (lemming) had a weaker effect on fox space use and an overall positive impact on the survival of incidental prey. These contrasting effects underline the importance of studying behavioural responses of predators in multiprey systems and to explicitly integrate behavioural-numerical responses in multispecies predator{\textendash}prey models.},

Within benthic marine ecosystems, both crustaceans and fishes can provide strong top-down pressure on prey populations. Taxon-specific differences in biomechanics or habitat use, among other factors, may lead to variable functional response forms or parameter values (attack rate, handling time). Based on a review of 189 individual functional response fits, we find that these predator guilds differ in their frequency distribution of functional response types, with crustaceans exhibiting nearly double the proportion of sigmoidal, density-dependent functional responses (Holling type III) as predatory fishes. The implications of this finding for prey population stability are significant because type III responses allow prey persistence while type II responses are de-stabilizing and can lead to extinction. Comparing per capita predation rates across diverse taxa can provide integrative insights into predatory effects and the ability of predation to drive community structure.},

"Stability" in ecology is a catch-all term that has been variously defined to reflect aspects of population and/or system equilibrium, persistence, resilience, resistance, and robustness. In some cases stability refers to the outcome of internal dynamics while in other cases it reflects the response of a population or system to a perturbation. The very notion of what is a plausible definition of ecosystem stability has driven some of the fundamental shifts in modeling methodology that will be described.},

We apply these four approaches to three examples of species interactions in spatially distributed populations and compare their predictions. Each represents different assumptions about the biology and hence a comparison among them has biological as well as modeling implications. In the first case all four approaches agree, in the second the spatial models disagree with the nonspatial ones, while in the third the stochastic models with discrete individuals disagree with the ones based on differential equations. We show further that the limiting reaction-diffusion equations associated with particle systems can have different qualitative behavior from those obtained by simply adding diffusion terms to mean field equations.},

Some theoretical work also suggests that weak interactions, especially in omnivorous links, are important for the local stability of a community at equilibrium. However, the majority of theoretical studies use uniform distributions of interaction strengths to generate artificial communities for study. We investigate the effects of the underlying interaction-strength distribution upon the return time, permanence and feasibility of simple Lotka-Volterra equilibrium communities. We show that a skew towards weak interactions promotes local and global stability only when omnivory is present. It is found that skewed interaction strengths are an emergent property of stable omnivorous communities, and that this skew towards weak interactions creates a dynamic constraint maintaining omnivory. Omnivory is more likely to occur when omnivorous interactions are skewed towards weak interactions. However, a skew towards weak interactions increases the return time to equilibrium, delays the recovery of ecosystems and hence decreases the stability of a community. When no skew is imposed, the set of stable omnivorous communities shows an emergent distribution of skewed interaction strengths. Our results apply to both local and global concepts of stability and are robust to the definition of a feasible community. These results are discussed in the light of empirical data and other theoretical studies, in conjunction with their broader implications for community assembly.},

Recent Findings               Recent advances in riverscape ecology highlight the need for spatially explicit examinations of how network structure influences ecological pattern and process, instead of the simple linear (upstream-downstream) view. Developments in GIS, remote sensing, and computer technologies already offer powerful tools for the application of patch- and gradient-based models for characterizing abiotic and biotic heterogeneity across a range of spatial and temporal scales. Along with graph-based analyses and spatial statistical stream network models (i.e., geostatistical modelling), these approaches offer improved capabilities for quantifying spatial and temporal heterogeneity and connectivity relationships, thereby allowing for rigorous and high-resolution analyses of pattern, process, and scale relationships.                                         Summary               Spatially explicit network approaches are able to quantify and predict biogeochemical, hydromorphological, and ecological patterns and processes more precisely than models based on longitudinal or lateral riverine gradients alone. Currently, local habitat characteristics appear to be more important than spatial effects in determining population and community dynamics, but this conclusion may change with direct quantification of the movement of materials, energy, and organisms along channels and across ecosystem boundaries{\textemdash}a key to improving riverscape ecology. Coupling spatially explicit riverscape models with optimization approaches will improve land protection and water management efforts, and help to resolve the land sharing vs. land sparing debate.},

We used repeat measurements of sixty-nine plots over ten years (2007{\textendash}2008 and 2017{\textendash}2018) to assess lichen biomass changes under a warming climate along a latitudinal/climatic gradient in northwestern Canada. We compared lichen biomass on sensitive landscape features, including peat plateaux (permafrost-containing bogs), areas of permafrost thaw within the peat plateaux (collapse scars), and low-productivity upland forests occurring on mineral soils. Field-based measures of lichen cover and height were coupled with samples of lichen biomass to develop biomass prediction equations. The optimal model incorporated both cover and height, with landscape feature as a covariate. Although height significantly improved the equation fit, models were successfully developed with cover alone. Modeled lichen biomass differed significantly between landscape features, declining from peat plateau (502 g m-2) to upland forest (54.0 g m-2) and collapse scar (0.690 g m-2) environments. In the absence of permafrost collapse at any monitoring location, lichen biomass declined significantly over the ten years for peat plateaux (-75.6 g m-2) and upland forests (-17.5 g m-2). These results will be important for quantifying landscape-level lichen biomass changes under climate warming in boreal and subarctic environments.},

Yet, our understanding of the relation between diversity and the stability of ecosystem functioning is still mainly limited to single trophic level communities and highly simplified food webs. To start filling this knowledge gap, we model allometric food webs and use structural equation modelling (SEM) to investigate the relations between diversity, food web structure and the temporal variability of total plant and animal biomasses and their components, i.e. synchrony and mean population variability. We find that stability responds differently depending on the metric used. When looking at total biomass variability, higher total biomasses and biomass stored at higher trophic level have the strongest stabilising effects, while species richness has lower impact than previously found. We confirm that synchrony among species is important for the stability of the total plant biomass. However, synchrony only weakly explains variations in the stability of total animal biomass among food webs. Species richness and food web variables often have opposite impacts on synchrony and mean population variability, leading to more ambiguous results for the plant community as synchrony matters only for plant stability. Our approach thus provides new insight on the complexity of the stability of ecosystem functioning in complex food webs.},

  abstract = {As a first step toward the development of coupled, basin scale models of ocean circulation and biogeochemical cycling, we present a model of the annual cycles of plankton dynamics and nitrogen cycling in the oceanic mixed layer. The model is easily modified and runs in FORTRAN on a personal computer. In our initial development and exploration of the model's behavior we have concentrated on modeling the annual cycle at Station "S" near Bermuda using seven compartments (Phytoplankton, Zooplankton, Bacteria, Nitrate, Ammonium, Dissolved organic nitrogen and Detritus). This choice of compartments and the attendant flows (fluxes or intercompartmental exchanges) permits a functional distinction between new and regenerated production. We have examined over 200 different runs and carried out sensitivity analyses. Results of model runs with detrital sinking rates of I and 10 meters per day are presented. In these runs, the phytoplankton biomass-specific mortality rate was varied to adjust the annual net primary production (NPP) for the mixed layer to a value equivalent to 45 gC m-2, which was calculated from the literature. Modelled cycles of zooplankton and bacterial stocks, and magnitudes of their annual production which cannot be validated due to sparse observations, are driven by the amplitude of the spring bloom and by changes in foodweb structure. Most, but not all model runs exhibit a spring bloom triggered by the winter depression of zooplankton stocks and the vernal increase in solar irradiance. The bloom is driven by nitrate entrained into the mixed layer during the wintertime deepening of the mixed layer. Following the shoaling of the pycnocline to ca 20 m, nitrate supply is limited to diffusional inputs, nitrate stocks are depleted, and regenerated production exceeds new production. The resulting cycles of new and regenerated production produce an annual cycle of the f-ratio with winter maxima approaching 0.8-0.9 and summer minima reaching ca 0.1-0.2, with annual values averaging 0.7. The model reproduces the "Eppley Curve," a hyperbolic relationship of increasing f with increasing primary production. This curve is shown to be the trajectory of the production system in the f-NPP phase plane. These model runs reproduce the annual cycles of areal NPP, and average annual NPP, new production, and particulate N flux values reported in the literature. The model demonstrates that currently accepted values for these annual fluxes can be reconciled only if the f-ratio has a high annual average. At present, the annual averagef-ratio is poorly quantified due to severe undersampling in fall and winter. Our model's ecological structure has been successfully incorporated into the Princeton general circulation model for the North Atlantic Ocean.},

Like any analysis technique, the accuracy of the results is as good as the data available, but the additional challenge is that the data need to characterize an entire ecosystem's flows and storages. Thus, data requirements are substantial. As a result, there have, in fact, not been a significant number of network models constructed and development of the network analysis methodology has progressed largely within the purview of a few established models. In this paper, we outline the steps for one approach to construct network models. Lastly, we also provide a brief overview of the algorithmic methods used to construct food web typologies when empirical data are not available. It is our aim that such an effort aids other researchers to consider the construction of such models as well as encourages further refinement of this procedure.},

With the help of automatic differentiation, we derive the adjoint code which is used to compute the exact gradient of a Bayesian cost function measuring the distance between the outputs of the model and catch and length frequency data. A sensitivity analysis shows that not all parameters can be estimated from the data.

This positive effect is less marked for deciduous forests. The increasing trend should be reduced by the end of the century for all forest types except mountain conifers because of increasing temperature and decreasing rainfall. Estimating the spatial and temporal variability of forest gross primary production (GPP) is a major issue of applied ecology, particularly in relation to ongoing and expected climate change. The current study proposes a methodological framework for analyzing large-scale forest responses to climate change in terms of GPP. The methodology utilizes the GPP estimates of an NDVI-driven model, C-Fix, to assess the performance of a biogeochemical model, BIOME-BGC. The two models were first applied at 1-km pixel scale in Italy over a period of 15 years (1999{\textendash}2013). The model outputs, aggregated on annual basis for the main Italian forest types, were inter-compared and analyzed in relation to major meteorological drivers (i.e., temperature and water-limiting factors). C-Fix and BIOME-BGC responded similarly to these major drivers, which supported the application of BIOME-BGC as a prognostic tool to simulate the GPP during three time slices of the RCP4.5 climate scenario. The results obtained highlight how the importance of spring temperature and water availability is diversified among the forest types in determining changes of forest GPP all over the Italian peninsula in a future climate.},

  abstract = {Abstract: The concept of an animal's home range has evolved over time, as have methods for estimating home-range size and shape. Recently, home-range estimation methods have focused on estimating an animal's utilization distribution (UD; i.e., the probability distribution defining the animal's use of space). We illustrate the importance of the utilization distribution in characterizing the degree of overlap between home ranges (e.g., when assessing site fidelity or space-use sharing among individuals). We compare several different statistics for their ability to accurately rank paired examples in terms of their degree of overlap. These examples illustrate limitations of indices commonly used to quantify home-range overlap and suggest that new overlap indices that are a function of the UD are likely to be more informative. We suggest 2 new statistics for measuring home-range overlap: (1) for a measure of space-use sharing, we suggest a generalization of Hurlbert's (1978) E/Euniform statistic, which we term the utilization distribution overlap index (UDOI), and (2) for a general measure of similarity between UD estimates, we suggest Bhattacharyya's affinity (BA; Bhattacharyya 1943). Using a short simulation study, we found that overlap indices can accurately rank pairs of UDs in terms of the extent of overlap, but estimates of overlap indices are likely to be biased. The extent of the bias depended on sample size and the degree of overlap (UDs with a high degree of overlap resulted in statistics that were more biased [low]), suggesting that comparisons across studies may be problematic. We illustrate the use of overlap indices to quantify the degree of similarity among UD estimates obtained using 2 different data collection methods (Global Positioning Systems [GPS] and very high frequency [VHF] radiotelemetry) for an adult female northern white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in north-central Minnesota.},

Integrated step-selection analyses also require several additional steps to translate model parameters into a full-fledged movement model, and the mathematics supporting this approach can be challenging for many to understand.Using simple examples, we demonstrate how weighted distribution theory and the inhomogeneous Poisson point process can facilitate parameter interpretation in habitat-selection analyses.

The effective corridor width is the minimum spatial dimension needed to abate human influence on animal movement through the corridor. We searched for case studies documenting the zone of influence and the flight initiation distance from recreational trails and residential development for four species of carnivore: black bears, grizzly (brown) bears, gray wolves, and cougars. From these studies, we synthesized information on the effective corridor width, which varied from 3000 to 6000~m for residential areas and 400 to 1000~m for trails, depending on the species. We examined the effective corridor width in a case study from Alberta, Canada, where debate over the appropriate width of designated wildlife corridors has been ongoing for decades. Our analysis is a step towards developing robust, empirically derived guidelines for designing and managing wildlife corridors.},

Understanding the movement ecology of animals following their release in novel terrain is critical to predicting the success of wildlife restoration efforts. Mountain caribou have high conservation value {\textendash} efforts to restore their populations across western Canada involve hundreds of millions of dollars in science, monitoring, and management activity. Here, we examined the movements of adult female caribou (N = 36) following their translocation to, and release from, a maternity pen (`penned caribou') and compared these movements to animals that were not translocated (`unpenned caribou', N = 22). A maternity pen is a temporary holding facility, within the animals' existing range, that enables them to bear and raise their young in the absence of predators and with augmented resources. Penned and unpenned animals had similar home range sizes (1052.2 and 1314.6 km2, respectively, P = 0.46) though penned animals moved through the landscape in a faster yet less directed manner. We found some evidence that memory may improve the efficiency of space use. Home ranges with higher quality habitats tended to be smaller than home ranges with poorer quality habitats irrespective of penning status. Penned animals ranged at lower elevation ( 150 m) than unpenned animals, particularly in spring and early winter. For penned animals, we did not detect evidence of homing back to the original capture site. The best predictor of how caribou will use the landscape appears to be proximity to the location of the release site. To maximize the fitness of released caribou, future plans for maternity pens and captive breeding programs need to consider the management of food, predators, and habitat across the 1000{\textendash}2000 km2 that will form the home range near the release site.},

  abstract = {A trophic cascade recently has been reported among wolves, elk, and aspen on the northern winter range of Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA, but the mechanisms of indirect interactions within this food chain have yet to be established. We investigated whether the observed trophic cascade might have a behavioral basis by exploring environmental factors influencing the movements of 13 female elk equipped with GPS radio collars. We developed a simple statistical approach that can unveil the concurrent influence of several environmental features on animal movements. Paths of elk traveling on their winter range were broken down into steps, which correspond to the straight-line segment between successive locations at 5-hour intervals. Each observed step was paired with 200 random steps having the same starting point, but differing in length and/or direction. Comparisons between the characteristics of observed and random steps using conditional logistic regression were used to model environmental features influencing movement patterns. We found that elk movements were influenced by multiple factors, such as the distance from roads, the presence of a steep slope along the step, and the cover type in which they ended. The influence of cover type on elk movements depended on the spatial distribution of wolves across the northern winter range of the park. In low wolf-use areas, the relative preference for end point locations of steps followed: aspen stands Ͼ open areas Ͼ conifer forests. As the risks of wolf encounter increased, the preference of elk for aspen stands gradually decreased, and selection became strongest for steps ending in conifer forests in high wolf-use areas. Our study clarifies the behavioral mechanisms involved in the trophic cascade of Yellowstone's wolf{\textendash}elk{\textendash}aspen system: elk respond to wolves on their winter range by a shift in habitat selection, which leads to local reductions in the use of aspen by elk.},

  abstract = {The assessment of disturbance effects on wildlife and resulting mitigation efforts are founded on edge-effect theory. According to the classical view, the abundance of animals affected by human disturbance should increase monotonically with distance from disturbed areas to reach a maximum at remote locations. Here we show that distance-dependent movement taxis can skew abundance distributions toward disturbed areas. We develop an advection-diffusion model based on basic movement behavior commonly observed in animal populations and parameterize the model from observations on radio-collared caribou in a boreal ecosystem. The model predicts maximum abundance at 3.7 km from cutovers and roads. Consistently, aerial surveys conducted over 161,920 km2 showed that the relative probability of caribou occurrence displays nonmonotonic changes with the distance to anthropogenic features, with a peak occurring at 4.5 km away from these features. This aggregation near disturbed areas thus provides the predators of this top-down-controlled, threatened herbivore species with specific locations to concentrate their search. The edge-effect theory developed here thus predicts that human activities should alter animal distribution and food web properties differently than anticipated from the current paradigm. Consideration of such nonmonotonic response to habitat edges may become essential to successful wildlife conservation.},

Yet, classic predator{\textendash}prey models assume spatially homogeneous interactions between predators and prey. We developed a spatially informed theory that predicts how habitat heterogeneity alters the landscape-scale distribution of mortality risk of prey from predation, and hence the nature of predator interactions in multiprey systems. The theoretical model is a spatially explicit, multiprey functional response in which species-specific advection{\textendash}diffusion models account for the response of individual prey to habitat edges. The model demonstrates that distinct responses of alternative prey species can alter the consequences of conspecific aggregation, from increasing safety to increasing predation risk. Observations of threatened boreal caribou, moose and grey wolf interacting over 378 181 km2 of human-managed boreal forest support this principle. This empirically supported theory demonstrates how distinct responses of apparent competitors to landscape heterogeneity, including to human disturbances, can reverse density dependence in fitness correlates.},

We estimated 3-fold differences in forest harvesting levels that caribou populations could withstand due to variations in forest productivity.

  abstract = {Understanding, predicting and controlling animal movement is a fundamental problem of conservation and management ecology. The need to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts, such as crop raiding by large herbivores, is becoming increasingly urgent. Because of the substantial costs or the possibility of unsuitable outcomes on wildlife, managers are often encouraged to deploy interventions that can achieve their objective while minimizing the impact on animal populations. We propose an adaptive management framework that can identify cost-effective solutions to reduce human-wildlife conflicts, while also minimizing constraints on animal movement and distribution. We focus on conflicts involving animals for which conflict zones occupy only a portion of their home-range. The adaptive management approach includes four basic steps: define and spatialize conflict areas, predict animal distribution from functional connectivity and patch residency time, predict the impact of management actions on animal distribution, and test predictions and revise predictive models. Key to the process is development of a mathematical model that can predict how habitat-animal interactions shape animal movement dynamics within patch networks. In our model, networks consist of a set of high-quality patches connected by links (i.e., potential inter-patch movements). Inter-patch movement rules and determinants of patch residency time need to be determined empirically. These data then provide information to parameterize a reaction-advection-diffusion model that can predict animal distribution dynamics given habitat features and movement taxis toward (or against) conflict areas depending on management actions. Illustrative simulations demonstrate how quantitative predictions can be used to make spatial adjustments in management interventions (e.g., length of diversionary fences) with respect of conflict areas. Simulations also show that the impact of multiple interventions cannot be considered as simply having additive effect, and their relative impact on animal equilibrium distribution depends on how they are added and deployed across the network. Following the principles of adaptive, integrated landscape management, Fortin et al. Mitigating Human-Wildlife Conflicts the predictive model should be revised as monitoring provides new information about the response of animals to the set of interventions. We contend that the proposed quantitative approach provides a robust framework to find cost-effective strategy toward sustainable human-wildlife conflicts.},

Here, we focus on the dynamics of ecological networks in response to environmental changes. Specifically, we formalize how network topologies constrain the dynamics of ecological systems into a unifying framework in network ecology that we refer to as the `ecological network dynamics framework'. This framework stresses that the interplay between species interaction networks and the spatial layout of habitat patches is key to identifying which network properties (number and weights of nodes and links) and trade-offs among them are needed to maintain species interactions in dynamic landscapes. We conclude that to be functional, ecological networks should be scaled according to species dispersal abilities in response to landscape heterogeneity. Determining how such effective ecological networks change through space and time can help reveal their complex dynamics in a changing world.},

  abstract = {Capelin (Mallotus villosus) is a short-lived (1{\textendash}4~years) fish species, that plays a crucial role by dominating the intermediate trophic level in the Barents Sea. Several episodes of extreme biomass decline (collapse) have been observed during the last three decades. We postulate that these collapses might be regulated by food availability (bottom-up effect) and/or by time discrepancy between capelin feeding and abundance of its prey (match-mismatch hypothesis). This paper investigates our postulate using a model consisting of a set of coupled differential equations to describe the predator-prey system, with a single delay term, {$\tau$}, in description of the predator dynamics. We derive theoretical conditions on {$\tau$}, as well as determine how changes in these conditions define different stability regimes of the system. Unconstrained optimization is used to calculate optimal model parameters by fitting the predator-prey model to empirical data. The optimization results are combined with those from the theoretical analysis, to make inference about the empirical system stability. Our results show that Hopf bifurcation occurs in the predatory-prey system when {$\tau$} exceeds a theoretically derived value {$\tau\ast>$}0. This value represents the critical time for prey availability in advance of the optimal predator growth period.Set into an ecological context, our findings provide mathematical evidence for validity of the match-mismatch hypothesis and a bottom-up effect for capelin.},

We also investigated how prey activity affects the foraging behavior and hunting success of predators. Our study supports key findings on predator foraging mode and predator-prey interactions from behavioral ecology. We found that individual predators displayed a diversity of hunting tactics that were conditioned by prey behavior. With prey movement, individual predators specialized either as cursorial or ambush hunters along a continuum of their hunting traits, but also shifted their strategy between encounters. Both types of hunters were generally better against slower moving prey, and they achieved similar prey captures over the sampling period. This suggests that virtual worlds supporting multiplayer online videogames can serve as legitimate systems to advance our knowledge on predator{\textendash}prey interactions.},

We used multivariate analyses to disentangle and compare spatio-temporal dynamics in community composition (i.e. changes in species abundances) and food web structure (i.e. changes in network properties). Specifically, we assessed how changes in community composition were reflected in food web structure. Our results revealed a strong spatial coupling between community composition and food web structure along a south{\textendash}north gradient. However, the temporal covariation between community composition and food web structure depended on the spatial scale.

  abstract = {Habitat loss, fragmentation and alteration are frequently identified as important threats to biodiversity, inducing major changes in the structure and composition of species communities and the resulting interspecific interactions. North American woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) populations suffer from habitat modifications and most are currently in decline. It has been suggested that the conversion of old-growth coniferous forests into early-seral stages has increased cervid abundances, which have, in turn, stimulated a numerical response of predator populations, ultimately threatening caribou populations via a habitat-mediated apparent competition mechanism. Using a long-term dataset (1984{\textendash}2012) of the Atlantic-Gasp{\'e}sie caribou population, we quantified changes in interspecific interactions triggered by apparent competition between moose (Alces americanus) and caribou via the responses of two incidental predators, coyote (Canis latrans) and black bear (Ursus americanus). We also documented calf recruitment rates and analysed temporal trends (last three decades) in this vital rate. Inter-annual variations in autumn calf recruitment were mostly affected by the proxy of regional abundance of coyotes, which was highly correlated with moose and black bear proxies of abundance. The increase in coyote abundance proxy in the Gasp{\'e}sie Peninsula following anthropogenic habitat modifications seems to be the main mechanism responsible for the current decline in the Atlantic-Gasp{\'e}sie caribou population. Our analyses revealed some impacts of habitat alteration and the complexity of the resulting trophic cascades.},

To evaluate this, we compared rates of survival and population growth by woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) from 2 study sites in northern Ontario, Canada that differed in the degree of anthropogenic disturbance because of commercial logging and road development, resulting in differences in predation risk due to gray wolves (Canis lupus). We used an individual-based model for population viability analysis (PVA) that incorporated adaptive patterns of caribou movement in relation to predation risk and food availability to predict stochastic variation in rates of caribou survival. Field estimates of annual survival rates for adult female caribou in the unlogged ( 0.90) and logged ( 0.76) study sites recorded during 2010{\textendash}2014 did not differ significantly (P {$>$} 0.05) from values predicted by the individual-based PVA model (unlogged: = 0.87; logged: 0.79). Outcomes from the individual-based PVA model and a simpler stage-structured matrix model suggest that substantial differences in adult survival largely due to wolf predation are likely to lead to long-term decline of woodland caribou in the commercially logged landscape, whereas the unlogged landscape should be considerably more capable of sustaining caribou. Estimates of population growth rates ({$\lambda$}) for the 2010{\textendash}2014 period differed little between the matrix model and the individual-based PVA model for the unlogged (matrix model = 1.01; individual-based model = 0.98) and logged landscape (matrix model = 0.88; individual-based model = 0.89). We applied the spatially explicit PVA model to assess the viability of woodland caribou across 14 woodland caribou ranges in Ontario. Outcomes of these simulations suggest that woodland caribou ranges that have experienced significant levels of commercial forestry activities in the past had annual growth rates {$<$}0.89, whereas caribou ranges that had not experienced commercial forestry operations had population growth rates {$>$}0.96. These differences were strongly related to regional variation in wolf densities. Our results suggest that increased wolf predation risk due to anthropogenic disturbance is of sufficient magnitude to cause appreciable risk of population decline in woodland caribou in Ontario. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Authors.

  abstract = {Population studies of wolves (Canis lupus) were carried out during October 1975-June 1978 on 2 study areas in northern Alberta; 13 wolves in 6 packs and 2 lone wolves were captured, radio-collared, and located 939 times. Telemetry data indicated a winter wolf density of 1/158 km2 near Fort McMurray. Numbers increased from 1975 to 1977 at a rate of about 21\% annually. The winter wolf density of 1/90km2 on a study area in the Swan Hills, 300 km southwest, appeared lower than in past years. The difference in wolf density between the 2 areas reflected available food resources. Trapping and early pup deaths were likely the major mortality factors. Wolves killed disproportionately more young, old, and probably debilitated moose (Alces alces), as well as more female calves and adult bulls. Most wolf kills in winter (88\%) were made in lowland habitats despite an even distribution of moose in uplands and lowlands. Deeper snow and colder temperatures in 1978 resulted in decreased travel by 1 pack (straight-line distances between daily locations of 5.7 vs. 9.0 km/day). The mean kill rate of this pack was similar in both years (1 moose/4.7 days); per capita consumption decreased slightly in 1978 (0.12 vs. 0.15 kg prey/kg wolf/day) because of larger mean pack size (9.8 vs. 9.2). An equation was derived for calculating true kill rates when relocation flights were spaced more than 1 day apart. Summer food habits of wolves (1,723 scats analyzed) indicated that adult moose remained the staple food in all areas. Use of beaver (Castor canadensis) was related to availability. One wolf pack annually consumed about 15\% of the yearling and older moose in their territory, close to the estimated 19\% annual recruitment of new yearlings. Two lone wolves and 2 packs were partially dependent on dumps for food during winter; predation rates by these packs were much lower. Wolf densities near disturbed sites were higher than in surrounding areas.},

We know little, however, about how the network of biotic interactions in which biodiversity is embedded changes with spatial extent. Here we develop a new theoretical framework that enables us to explore how different assembly mechanisms and theoretical models affect multiple properties of ecological networks across space. We present a number of testable predictions on network{\textendash}area relationships (NARs) for multi-trophic communities. Network structure changes as area increases because of the existence of different SARs across trophic levels, the preferential selection of generalist species at small spatial extents and the effect of dispersal limitation promoting beta-diversity. Developing an understanding of NARs will complement the growing body of knowledge on SARs with potential applications in conservation ecology. Specifically, combined with further empirical evidence, NARs can generate predictions of potential effects on ecological communities of habitat loss and fragmentation in a changing world.},

  abstract = {Mutualistic communities have an internal structure that makes them resilient to external perturbations. Late research has focused on their stability and the topology of the relations between the different organisms to explain the reasons of the system robustness. Much less attention has been invested in analyzing the systems dynamics. The main population models in use are modifications of the r-K formulation of logistic equation with additional terms to account for the benefits produced by the interspecific interactions. These models have shortcomings as the so-called r-K formulation diverges under some conditions. In this work, we introduce a model for population dynamics under mutualism that preserves the original logistic formulation. It is mathematically simpler than the widely used type II models, although it shows similar complexity in terms of fixed points and stability of the dynamics. We perform an analytical stability analysis and numerical simulations to study the model behavior in general interaction scenarios including tests of the resilience of its dynamics under external perturbations. Despite its simplicity, our results indicate that the model dynamics shows an important richness that can be used to gain further insights in the dynamics of mutualistic communities.},

By complexity we refer to the degree of richness of food-web architecture, measured in terms of some topological indicators (number of persistent species and links, connectance, link density, number of trophic levels, and frequency of weak links). The poorest food-web architecture is found for a mean-field scenario where all foraging preferences are assumed to be the same. Richer food webs appear when foraging preferences depend on the trophic position of species. Food-web complexity increases with the number of basal species. We also find a strong correlation between the complexity of a trophic module and the complexity of entire food webs with the same pattern of foraging preferences.},

A trophic-level (TL)-based ecosystem modelling approach is presented, where ecosystem functioning is modelled as a flow of biomass up the foodweb through predation and ontogenetic processes. The approach, based on simple equations derived from fluid dynamics, provides insights into ecosystem functioning and the impact of fishing. A virtual ecosystem is simulated and the model shown to be capable of mimicking the effects of various exploitation patterns on ecosystem biomass expected from the theory. It provides the theoretical basis to explain complex patterns, such as cascading effects, maximum sustainable ecosystem yield, and fishing down the foodweb. The utility of the TL-based approach as a practical tool for determining fishing impacts in specific ecosystems is illustrated using the Guinean ecosystem as a case study, showing how current fishing effort levels led to full exploitation of higher TLs, confirming and generalizing previous single-species assessment results. Finally, catch trophic spectrum analysis is presented to show that it provides reliable biomass estimates when catches per TL and primary production are known.},

This method takes into account some sources of uncertainty related to the estimation of productivity and fire risk. Spatialization of stand productivity from growth and yield curves allowed us to compute the area comprised of productive stands of each district with or without considering fire risk. Results showed that productive area is generally decreasing with decreasing degree-days, increasing elevation, or in relation to surficial geology.

As a result, scientists are now engaged in making predictions about an uncertain future, which entails the efficient communication of this uncertainty. Here we show the benefits of hierarchically decomposing the uncertainty in predicted changes in animal population size into its components due to structural uncertainty in climate scenarios (greenhouse gas emissions and global circulation models), structural uncertainty in the demographic model, climatic stochasticity, environmental stochasticity unexplained by climate{\textendash}demographic trait relationships, and sampling variance in demographic parameter estimates. We quantify components of uncertainty surrounding the future abundance of a migratory bird, the greater snow goose (Chen caeruslescens atlantica), using a process-based demographic model covering their full annual cycle. Our model predicts a slow population increase but with a large prediction uncertainty. As expected from theoretical variance decomposition rules, the contribution of sampling variance to prediction uncertainty rapidly overcomes that of process variance and dominates. Among the sources of process variance, uncertainty in the climate scenarios contributed less than 3\% of the total prediction variance over a 40-year period, much less than environmental stochasticity. Our study exemplifies opportunities to improve the forecasting of complex systems using long-term studies and the challenges inherent to predicting the future of stochastic systems.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we have investigated the phenomena of Turing pattern formation in a predator-prey model with habitat complexity in presence of cross diffusion. Using the linear stability analysis, the conditions for the existence of stationary pattern and the existence of Hopf bifurcation are obtained. It is shown analytically that the presence of cross diffusion in the system supports the formation of Turing pattern. Two parameter bifurcation analysis are done analytically and corresponding bifurcation diagrams are presented numerically. A series of simulation results are plotted for different biologically meaningful parameter values. Effects of variation of habitat complexity and the predator mortality rate and birth rate of prey on pattern formation are also reported. It is shown that cross-diffusion can lead to a wide variety of spatial and spatiotemporal pattern formation. It is found that the model exhibits spot and stripe pattern, and coexistence of both spot and strip patterns under the zero flux boundary condition. It is observed that cross-diffusion, habitat complexity, birth rate of prey and predator's mortality rate play a significant role in the pattern formation of a distributed population system of predator-prey type.},

The composition of Caspian tern (CATE) and double-crested cormorant (DCCO) diets broadly overlapped with each other and with independent purse seine sampling. However, consistent seasonal differences were observed in the mass of salmonid and marine forage fish prey in net sampling and the diets of piscivorous birds; Caspian terns had a higher proportion of salmonids in their diets than did cormorants or net sampling across seasons in all years. Caspian terns responded nonlinearly to the availability of marine forage fish, with the proportion of juvenile salmonids in their diet significantly declining when the proportion of marine prey species available exceeded a threshold of 48\%. In contrast, cormorants showed a weak, linear response in this relationship. These results demonstrate how temporal variation in one prey type (marine forage fish that enter the estuary later in summer) can indirectly reduce consumption of another prey type (juvenile salmonids) by a common predator (piscivorous birds){\textemdash}an apparent mutualism. This work shows the importance of understanding the broader food web. Developing management strategies that account for avian predator response to variation in the prey fish community will be important for increasing the survival of threatened and endangered salmonids in a changing environment.},

In a constant environment, compensatory dynamics between species can maintain food web stability, but factors that synchronize population fluctuations within and between communities are expected to be destabilizing. We studied the dynamics of a food web in a metacommunity to determine how environmental variability and dispersal affect stability by altering compensatory dynamics and average species abundance. When dispersal rate is high, weak correlated environmental fluctuations promote food web stability by reducing the amplitude of compensatory dynamics. However, when dispersal rate is low, weak environmental fluctuations reduce food web stability by inducing intraspecific synchrony across communities. Irrespective of dispersal rate, strong environmental fluctuations disrupt compensatory dynamics and decrease stability by inducing intermittent correlated fluctuations between consumers in local food webs, which reduce both total consumer abundance and predator abundance. Strong correlated environmental fluctuations lead to (i) spatially asynchronous and highly correlated local consumer dynamics when dispersal is low and (ii) spatially synchronous but intermediate local consumer correlation when dispersal is high. By controlling intraspecific synchrony, dispersal mediates the capacity of strong environmental fluctuations to disrupt compensatory dynamics at both local and metacommunity scales.},

Twenty-four Class I stands (complete NPP budgets) and 45 Class II boreal forest stands (aboveground NPP [NPPA] and budget only) were identified. The geographic distribution of the Class I stands was not uniform; 46\%of the stands were from two studies in North America, and only one stand was from the important larch forests of Eurasia. Total (above- and belowground) net primary production (NPPT) ranged from 52 to 868 g C-m-2-yr-' and averaged 424 g C-m-2-yr-'. NPPA was consistently larger for deciduous than for evergreen boreal forests in each of the major boreal regions, especially for boreal forests in Alaska. Belowground net primary production:total net primary production (NPPB: NPPT) ratios were consistently larger for evergreen (0.36)than deciduous (0.19) boreal forests. NPP of different-aged stands in age sequence varied from 44\%to 77\%,a magnitude equal to or greater than that of climatic factors or vegetation type. NPP and NPPA were positively correlated (r2 = 0.66-0.68)to mean annual aboveground increment for Class I stands, and this empirical relationship explained 81\%of the observed variation of NPPA for Class II stands. These robust relationships provide an approach for increasing the number and spatial coverage of boreal forest NPP data needed to evaluate NPP estimates from ecosystem models. Notable deficiencies of boreal forest NPP data were ground layer vegetation and belowground NPP data, NPP data for boreal forest age sequences, and NPP data for boreal larch ecosystems in Eurasia.},

  abstract = {Increased fire activity due to climate change may impact the successional dynamics of boreal forests, with important consequences for caribou habitat. Early successional forests have been shown to support lower quantities of caribou forage lichens, but geographic variation in, and controls on, the rates of lichen recovery has been largely unexplored. In this study, we sampled across a broad region in northwestern Canada to compare lichen biomass accumulation in ecoprovinces, including the Saskatchewan Boreal Shield, the Northwest Territories Taiga Shield, and Northwest Territories Taiga Plains, divided into North and South. We focused on the most valuable Cladonia species for boreal and barren-ground caribou: Cladonia mitis and C. arbuscula, C. rangiferina and C. stygia, and C. stellaris and C. uncialis. We developed new allometric equations to estimate lichen biomass from field measurements of lichen cover and height; allometries were consistent among ecoprovinces, suggesting generalizability. We then used estimates of lichen biomass to quantify patterns of lichen recovery in different stand types, ecoprovinces, and with time following stand-replacing fire. We used a hurdle model to account both for the heterogeneous nature of lichen presence (zero inflation) and for the range of abundance in stands where lichen was present. The first component of the hurdle model, a generalized linear model, identified stand age, stand type, and ecoprovince as significant predictors of lichen presence. With a logistic growth model, a measure of lichen recovery (time to 50\% asymptotic value) varied from 28 to 73 yr, dependent on stand type and ecoprovince. The combined predictions of the hurdle model suggest the most rapid recovery of lichen biomass across our study region occurred in jack pine in the Boreal Shield (30 yr), while stands located in the Taiga Plains (North and South) required a longer recovery period (approximately 75 yr). These results provide a basis for estimating future caribou habitat that encompasses some of the large variation in fire effects on lichen abundance and vegetation types across the range of boreal and barren-ground caribou in North America.},

  abstract = {Dispersal and foodweb dynamics have long been studied in separate models. However, over the past decades, it has become abundantly clear that there are intricate interactions between local dynamics and spatial patterns. Trophic meta-communities, i.e. meta-foodwebs, are very complex systems that exhibit complex and often counterintuitive dynamics. Over the past decade, a broad range of modelling approaches have been used to study these systems. In this paper, we review these approaches and the insights that they have revealed. We focus particularly on recent papers that study trophic interactions in spatially extensive settings and highlight the common themes that emerged in different models. There is overwhelming evidence that dispersal (and particularly intermediate levels of dispersal) benefits the maintenance of biodiversity in several different ways. Moreover, some insights have been gained into the effect of different habitat topologies, but these results also show that the exact relationships are much more complex than previously thought, highlighting the need for further research in this area.

Wildlife managers must identify actions to conserve and manage alpine species into the future, while considering other issues and uncertainties. Climate change and respiratory pathogens associated with widespread pneumonia epidemics in bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) may negatively affect mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) populations. Mountain goat demographic and population data are challenging to collect and sparsely available, making population management decisions difficult. We developed predictive models incorporating these uncertainties and analyzed results within a structured decision making framework to make management recommendations and identify priority information needs in Montana, USA. We built resource selection models to forecast occupied mountain goat habitat and account for uncertainty in effects of climate change, and a Leslie matrix projection model to predict population trends while accounting for uncertainty in population demographics and dynamics. We predicted disease risks while accounting for uncertainty about presence of pneumonia pathogens and risk tolerance for mixing populations during translocations. Our analysis predicted that new introductions would produce more area occupied by mountain goats at mid-century, regardless of the effects of climate change. Population augmentations, carnivore management, and harvest management may improve population trends, although this was associated with considerable uncertainty. Tolerance for risk of disease transmission affected optimal management choices because translocations are expected to increase disease risks for mountain goats and sympatric bighorn sheep. Expected value of information analyses revealed that reducing uncertainty related to population dynamics would affect the optimal choice among management strategies to improve mountain goat trends. Reducing uncertainty related to the presence of pneumonia-associated pathogens and consequences of mixing microbial communities should reduce disease risks if translocations are included in future management strategies. We recommend managers determine tolerance for disease risks associated with translocations that they and constituents are willing to accept. From this, an adaptive management program can be constructed wherein a portfolio of management actions are chosen based on risk tolerance in each population range, combined with the amount that uncertainty is reduced when paired with monitoring, to ultimately improve achievement of fundamental objectives. Mountain goat management in Montana is complicated by climate, demographic, and disease uncertainty and multiple, competing fundamental objectives. Addressing disease risk tolerance within an adaptive management program to reduce demographic and disease uncertainty should improve achievement of fundamental objectives for mountain goat management in Montana.},

Past studies have rarely included detailed data on human activities, but instead treated fixed infrastructure as valid proxies for human presence. However, ignoring the dynamic and flexible nature of human agency as a driver of disturbance may bias our interpretation of the observed responses. We argue that incorporating information about the spatiotemporal patterns of human use of infrastructure and the characteristics of the users may greatly improve our knowledge of the potential impacts on wild and semi-domestic reindeer populations and contribute to improved management of their ranges.},

It is a challenge for theory to find models that can reproduce and explain the observed patterns. Since the advent of island biogeography these models revolve around speciation, dispersal, and extinction, but they usually neglect trophic structure. Here, we propose and study a spatially extended evolutionary food web model that allows us to study large spatial systems with several trophic layers. Our computer simulations show that the model gives rise simultaneously to several biodiversity patterns in space and time, from species abundance distributions to the waxing and waning of geographic ranges. We find that trophic position in the network plays a crucial role when it comes to the time evolution of range sizes, because the trophic context restricts the occurrence and survival of species especially on higher trophic levels.},

Firstly, the problem is confirmed to be well-posed and some basic preliminaries are provided within the context of the temporal environment. Subsequently, both the local and the global stability of the temporal system including permanence are thoroughly investigated so as to emerge the fact that the competition between the hunting cooperation factor               a               and the refuge coefficient               r               can resolve the dynamics of the system. More precisely, global stability for all of the feasible non-negative equilibria corresponding to the temporal environment and the coexistence equilibrium in the spatiotemporal domain are explored in the event of the hunting cooperation factor               a               not exceeding the prey refuge coefficient               r               .

Nevertheless, a distinct Turing instability mechanism is emerged when the prey diffusivity exceeds that of predator but interestingly, the opposite is customarily a reasonable constraint in many predator{\textendash}prey models. Later on, the diffusion coefficient is chosen as a bifurcation parameter interpreting pattern transition and the amplitude equations close to the onset are thereby derived. The stability analysis is made use of to explain the selection of patterns among hot spot patterns, the mixture of hot spots and stripes patterns and the stripe patterns themselves. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to explore pattern selection influenced by the hunting cooperation factor, the prey refuge coefficient and the diffusivity as well. Some interesting dynamical complexities including the variation of the number of equilibria, the bifurcation scenario, etc, also emerge out from such quantitative simulations.},

  abstract = {A central challenge in ecology is to predict long-term consequences of high herbivore densities on their resources. Here we describe vegetation changes during 26~years following the reintroduction of a wild Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) population that was not subject to predation. The population irrupted, crashed and subsequently fluctuated around lower densities throughout the study period. The irruption generated strong trophic top-down effects on the vegetation including a decline in the cover of mosses, vascular plants and lichens. Previously dominant fruticose lichens, which are preferred forage during winter, were almost depleted and showed no response to the relief in grazing pressure. This in turn indirectly affected rates of recovery in other plant groups subsequent to the crash. Mosses recovered completely and even exceeded pre-reindeer levels 6~years after the population peak. Recovery of vascular plants was more delayed and only partial due to a long-term suppression of common species that are important as reindeer forage. Thus, a suppression of major forage species and a sustained reduction in herbivore densities suggest that overgrazing occurred during the population irruption, possibly inducing a long-term decline in reindeer carrying capacity K. This supports the ``exploitation ecosystem hypothesis'' predicting top-down control of vegetation by herbivores when predators are absent.},

  abstract = {(1) Two kinds of predation affecting the dynamics of microtine rodent populations have received increasing attention in recent years. It has been suggested that specialist mammalian predators (small mustelids) maintain or at least significantly contribute to the regular multi-annual cycles of rodent populations in northern Europe. Generalist predators (foxes, common buzzards, cats, etc.) are assumed to stabilize rodent populations in more southern localities. (2) Combining the two kinds of predation in the same predator-prey model demonstrates that the generalist predators have a stabilizing effect on a cycle driven by specialist predators. (3) In the model, the ratio of the maximum over the minimum prey population size and the length of the prey cycle decrease with increasing numbers of generalist predators. Sufficiently large numbers of generalist predators convert the limit cycle to a stable equilibrium point. (4) The numbers of generalist predators greatly increase from north to south in Fennoscandia. In agreement with the model predictions, the ratio of the maximum over the minimum rodent density decreases by an order of magnitude, and the length of the cycle decreases from 5 to 3 years, from the seventieth to the sixtieth parallel. There is no clear multiannual cycle below 60 degrees N.},

The model is constructed as a generalized incidence function, which describes how the fraction of occupied habitat patches depends on patch areas and isolations. 2. The model may be fitted to presence/absence data from a metapopulation at a dynamic equilibrium between extinctions and colonizations. 3. Using the estimated parameter values, transient dynamics and the equilibrium fraction of occupied patches in any system of habitat patches can be predicted. The significance of particular habitat patches for the long-term persistence of the metapopulation, for example, can also be evaluated. 4. The model is fitted to data from three butterfly metapopulations. The model predicts well the observed minimum patch size for occupancy and the numbers of extinctions and colonizations per year (turnover rate). The results suggest that local populations of the three butterflies in patches of 1 ha, which may support of the order of 1000 adult butterflies, have an expected lifetime of 20-100 years.},

Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

This review study aimed to examine GT in the field of ecological network analysis based on the following questions: In what areas are the articles focused?, what indexes or graph-based indicators have been thus far utilized in ecological network analysis?, and what aspects of ecological network analysis have been less considered in terms of the use of the GT indicators? To address these questions, a systematic literature review was conducted and the results showed that most of the articles in this field had been fulfilled in China, the United States, and France. This theory could have implications for more research on plants and mammals. In addition, 118 indicators were identified in the field of GT in the ecological network analysis. Among these indicators, the probability of connectivity (PC) and an integral index of connectivity (IIC) had been consistently exploited in most articles. Moreover, the results revealed the increasing trend of introducing the new indicators of GT to ecological network analysis, suggesting the applicability of GT in this context. Despite the importance of ecological network resilience, it has been less reflected from the GT perspective while it can be useful and efficient in analyzing the sustainability of ecological networks within this framework. The current trend of exploiting the GT indicators delineates three future lines of development, viz. (1) the GT use more widely in ecological network analysis, (2) emerging new and more precise indexes, and (3) new concerns mainly examining ecological network resilience.},

While stationary Turing patterns are broadly known, the oscillatory instability, leading to traveling waves in continuous media and sometimes called the wave bifurcation, remains less investigated. Here, we extend the original analysis by Turing to networks and apply it to ecological metapopulations with dispersal connections between habitats. Remarkably, the oscillatory Turing instability does not lead to wave patterns in networks, but to spontaneous development of heterogeneous oscillations and possible extinction of species. We find such oscillatory instabilities for all possible food webs with three predator or prey species, under various assumptions about the mobility of individual species and nonlinear interactions between them. Hence, the oscillatory Turing instability should be generic and must play a fundamental role in metapopulation dynamics, providing a common mechanism for dispersal-induced destabilization of ecosystems.},

To better understand changes in moose populations coinciding with this period of declining harvest, we modelled population dynamics within 31 Game Management Zones (GMZs). We used aerial survey data (180 density and 159 composition surveys) combined with licensed harvest to develop 4 competing statistical models to assess population dynamics based on constant parameters and temporal trends in calf:cow ratios at 6 months, juvenile survival from 6{\textendash}18 months, or cow survival. The models indicated that moose populations declined ({$\lambda$} {$<$} 1) in 7 GMZs (23\%) from 1996{\textendash}2005 and in 22 GMZs (71\%) from 2006{\textendash}2015. Over the 20-year period, the best model was fit with declining trends in calf:cow ratios in 8 GMZs, declining juvenile survival in 6 GMZs, and declining cow survival in 8 GMZs. Population growth rate was slightly reduced in those GMZs where licenced antlerless (cow and calf) hunting occurred but was not considered the primary factor causing population decline. Total licenced bull harvest influenced bull:cow ratios that were significantly lower in 2006{\textendash}2015 (x = 37:100) than 1995{\textendash}2005 (x = 48:100); significant predictive relationships existed between harvest rates and bull:cow ratios. Provincial moose numbers and harvest were highly correlated (r = 0.81) suggesting that declining harvest was a reaction to declining population trends. We found that the provincial moose population increased 6\% from 1996{\textendash}2005, subsequently declined 32\% from 2006{\textendash}2015, and declined 29\% overall during the 20-year study period.},

Our model adjusts predation seasonally depending on caribou distribution: Pannual = SIGMAdaily* W *Ap(2)*Dp. In our model we assumed that wolves killed adult caribou at a constant rate (Kdaily, 0.08 caribou wolf1 day1) based on our studies and elsewhere; that wolf density (W) doubled to 6 wolves 1000 km2-1 on all seasonal ranges; and that the average area occupied by the Porcupine caribou herd (PCH) in eight seasonal life cycle periods (Dp ) was two times gteater than the area described by the outer boundaries of telemetry data (Ap /1000 km2). Results from our model projected that wolves kill about 7600 adult caribou each year, regardless of herd size. The model estimated that wolves removed 5.8 to 7.4\% of adult caribou as the herd declined in the 1990s. Our predation rate model supports the hypothesis of Bergerud that spacing away by caribou is an effective anti-predatory strategy that greatly reduces wolf predation on adult caribou in the spring and summer.\vphantom\}},

We added these data to the cumulative functional response curve obtained in other North American wolf studies. Our kill rates are higher than those predicted at low moose densities. The kill rate increases rapidly, reaching 2.4 moose per wolf per 100 days at 0.26 moose/km 2 and remains constant at this level. No data are available below 0.2 moose/km 2 to indicate the shape of the ascending curve. Based on moose distribution and the low prey-switching ability of wolves, we suggest that the functional response curve is of type II. Our wolf predation rate model predicts that moose are held to a low density equilibrium between 0.07 and 0.12/km 2 , slightly below densities observed in interior Alaska and the Yukon.},

  abstract = {A central goal of ecology is identifying the mechanisms that allow large, complex food webs to persist. Spatial mechanisms resulting from dispersal connections among local food webs are one factor shown to play a significant role in enabling species persistence, particularly by driving asynchrony in the dynamics among local food webs. However, it is still unknown how these spatial persistence mechanisms operate across food webs. Using simulations of full non-linear food web models, we investigate how spatial persistence mechanisms emerge in multi-species food webs that possess different structural metrics. Specifically, we ask whether 1) spatial persistence mechanisms work similarly across food webs, and 2) if differences can be explained by food web features influencing stability in the absence of dispersal, particularly trophic structure. Food web structures are generated using the allometric niche model that is capable of reproducing realistic feeding patterns and interaction strengths. Our analyses quantify the tendency of modeled food webs to achieve asynchrony in the presence of dispersal and show that this positively affects the ability of species in the food web to persist. We observe an inverse relationship between the ability of food webs to persist when isolated and their tendency to be asynchronous when spatial, indicating a limited ability of food webs that persist when isolated to benefit from spatial persistence mechanisms. Our results demonstrate a relatively unexplored layer of food web properties which determine the ability of a food web to capitalize on the stabilizing opportunities created by dispersal, specifically those that influence the tendency for dispersal-linked food webs to be asynchronous. Future studies should expand on our results by examining how properties of spatial connections and food webs influence the ability of food webs to achieve asynchrony.},

  abstract = {Predation is a fundamental ecological and evolutionary process that varies in space, and the avoidance of predation risk is of central importance in foraging theory. While there has been a recent growth of approaches to spatially model predation risk, these approaches lack an adequate mechanistic framework that can be applied to real landscapes. In this paper we show how predation risk can be decomposed into encounter and attack stages, and modeled spatially using resource selection functions (RSF) and resource selection probability functions (RSPF). We use this approach to compare the effects of landscape attributes on the relative probability of encounter, the conditional probability of death given encounter, and overall wolf and elk resource selection to test whether predation risk is simply equivalent to location of the predator. We then combine the probability of encounter and conditional probability of death into a spatially explicit function of predation risk following Lima and Dill's reformulation of Holling's functional response. We illustrate this approach in a wolf{\textendash}elk system in and adjacent to Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada. In this system we found that the odds of elk being encountered by wolves was 1.3 times higher in pine forest and 4.1 times less in grasslands than other habitats. The relative odds of being killed in pine forests, given an encounter, increased by 1.2. Other habitats, such as grasslands, afforded elk reduced odds (4.1 times less) of being encountered and subsequently killed (1.4 times less) by wolves. Our approach illustrates that predation risk is not necessarily equivalent to just where predators are found. We show that landscape attributes can render prey more or less susceptible to predation and effects of landscape features can differ between the encounter and attack stages of predation. We conclude by suggesting applications of our approach to model predator{\textendash}prey dynamics using spatial predation risk functions in theoretical and applied settings.},

  abstract = {Woodland caribou populations are considered threatened in Alberta and have declined in the Canadian Rocky Mountain National Parks of Banff and Jasper despite protection from factors causing caribou populations to decline outside of parks. Recent research emphasizes the importance of the numeric response of wolves to moose in moose-caribou-wolf systems to caribou persistence. Moose are rare in the Canadian Rockies, where the dominant ungulate prey for wolves is elk. Few studies have explored wolf-elk dynamics and none have examined implications for caribou. We used data collected in Banff to estimate the numeric response of wolves to elk from 1985 to 2005. Because no caribou kill-rate data exist for the Rockies, we explore the consequences of a range of hypothetical kill-rates based on kill-rates of alternate prey collected from 1985 to 2000 in Banff. We then multiplied the numeric response of wolves by the estimated caribou kill-rates to estimate the wolf predation response on caribou as a function of elk density. Caribou predation rates were inversely density dependent because wolf numbers depend on prey species besides caribou in multiple prey species systems. We then combined this simple wolf-elk-caribou model with observed demographic and population estimates for Banff and Jasper caribou from 2003-2004 and solved for the critical kill-rate thresholds above which caribou populations would decline. Using these critical kill-rate thresholds, Jasper caribou are likely to persist when wolf densities are below 2.1 - 4.3 wolves/1000km2 and/or when elk densities are below 0.015- 0.033 elk/km2. Thresholds for Banff caribou persistence are much lower because of inverse density dependence. Future research is needed on some of the necessary assumptions underlying our modeling including multi-prey wolf numeric responses, wolf kill-rates of caribou, caribou mortality by other predators, and spatial aspects of wolf-elk-caribou dynamics.},

  abstract = {Mammalian herbivores have important top-down effects on ecological processes and landscapes by generating vegetation changes through grazing and trampling. For free-ranging herbivores on large landscapes, trampling is an important ecological factor. However, whereas grazing is widely studied, low-intensity trampling is rarely studied and quantified. The cold-adapted northern tundra reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) is a wide-ranging keystone herbivore in large open alpine and Arctic ecosystems. Reindeer may largely subsist on different species of slow-growing ground lichens, particularly in winter. Lichen grows in dry, snow-poor habitats with frost. Their varying elasticity makes them suitable for studying trampling. In replicated factorial experiments, high-resolution 3D laser scanning was used to quantify lichen volume loss from trampling by a reindeer hoof. Losses were substantial, that is, about 0.3~dm3 per imprint in dry thick lichen, but depended on type of lichen mat and humidity. Immediate trampling volume loss was about twice as high in dry, compared to humid thin (2{\textendash}3~cm), lichen mats and about three times as high in dry vs. humid thick (6{\textendash}8~cm) lichen mats, There was no significant difference in volume loss between 100\% and 50\% wetted lichen. Regained volume with time was insignificant for dry lichen, whereas 50\% humid lichen regained substantial volumes, and 100\% humid lichen regained almost all lost volume, and mostly within 10{\textendash}20~min. Reindeer trampling may have from near none to devastating effects on exposed lichen forage. During a normal week of foraging, daily moving 5~km across dry 6- to 8-cm-thick continuous lichen mats, one adult reindeer may trample a lichen volume corresponding to about a year's supply of lichen. However, the lichen humidity appears to be an important factor for trampling loss, in addition to the extent of reindeer movement.},

  abstract = {Reef ecosystems are highly diverse habitats that harbor many ecologically and economically significant species. Yet, globally they are under threat from multiple stressors including overexploitation of predatory fishes and habitat degradation. While these two human-driven activities often occur concomitantly, they are typically studied independently. Using a factorial design, we examined effects of predator presence, habitat complexity, and their interaction on patch reef fish communities in a nearshore ecosystem on Great Abaco Island, The Bahamas. We manipulated the presence of Nassau groupers (Epinephelus striatus), a reef predator that is critically endangered largely due to overharvest, and varied patch reef structure (cinder blocks with and without PVC) to reflect high or low complexity-four treatments in total. To assess changes in fish community composition we measured fish abundances, species richness, and evenness. We found that predators present and high reef complexity had an additive, positive effect on total fish abundance: fish abundance increased by\,{\textasciitilde}\,250\% and 300\%, compared to predators absent and low complexity reef treatments, respectively. Species richness increased with reef complexity. Variation in community structure was explained by the interaction between factors, largely driven by juvenile Tomtate grunt (Haemulon aurolineatum) abundances. Specifically, Tomtate grunt abundance was significantly higher on high complexity reefs with predators present, but on low complexity reefs predators present had no effect on Tomtate grunt abundance. Our data suggest that both fisheries management of large-bodied piscivores and reef habitat restoration are critical to the management and conservation of reef ecosystem functions and services.},

  abstract = {Animal tracking and biologging devices record large amounts of data on individual movement behaviors in natural environments. In these data, movement ecologists often view unexplained variation around the mean as ``noise'' when studying patterns at the population level. In the field of behavioral ecology, however, focus has shifted from population means to the biological underpinnings of variation around means. Specifically, behavioral ecologists use repeated measures of individual behavior to partition behavioral variability into intrinsic among-individual variation and reversible behavioral plasticity and to quantify: a) individual variation in behavioral types (i.e. different average behavioral expression), b) individual variation in behavioral plasticity (i.e. different responsiveness of individuals to environmental gradients), c) individual variation in behavioral predictability (i.e. different residual within-individual variability of behavior around the mean), and d) correlations among these components and correlations in suites of behaviors, called `behavioral syndromes'. We here suggest that partitioning behavioral variability in animal movements will further the integration of movement ecology with other fields of behavioral ecology. We provide a literature review illustrating that individual differences in movement behaviors are insightful for wildlife and conservation studies and give recommendations regarding the data required for addressing such questions. In the accompanying R tutorial we provide a guide to the statistical approaches quantifying the different aspects of among-individual variation. We use movement data from 35 African elephants and show that elephants differ in a) their average behavior for three common movement behaviors, b) the rate at which they adjusted movement over a temporal gradient, and c) their behavioral predictability (ranging from more to less predictable individuals). Finally, two of the three movement behaviors were correlated into a behavioral syndrome (d), with farther moving individuals having shorter mean residence times. Though not explicitly tested here, individual differences in movement and predictability can affect an individual's risk to be hunted or poached and could therefore open new avenues for conservation biologists to assess population viability. We hope that this review, tutorial, and worked example will encourage movement ecologists to examine the biology of individual variation in animal movements hidden behind the population mean.},

We tested the hypothesis that wolf (Canis lupus L., 1758) population reduction could reverse declines in a woodland caribou population following a BACI (before-after-control-impact) design conducted over a 12-year period in west-central Alberta, Canada. We monitored annual survival for 172 adult female caribou and calf recruitment from 2000 through 2012 and conducted a provincial government delivered wolf population reduction program annually during the winters of 2005{\textendash}2006 to 2012 (inclusive) in an area centered on the Little Smoky range. Wolf removal translated to a 4.6\% increase in mean population growth rate of the Little Smoky population mostly through improvements in calf recruitment. In contrast, the Red Rock Prairie Creek control population exhibited a 4.7\% decline. Although the wolf population reduction program appeared to stabilize the Little Smoky population, it did not lead to population increase, however, with {$\lambda$} remaining approximately equal to 1. Therefore, we recommend, if required, predation management be combined with effective habitat conservation and long-term planning to effect the recovery of species, such as woodland caribou, which are declining as a result of habitat-mediated apparent competition.},

To serve as basework to the establishment of conservation measures for the species, we have studied the hierarchical habitat selection of forest-dwelling caribou in a boreal landscape of Que{\textasciiacute} bec strongly impacted by logging. Fifteen females were surveyed by GPS telemetry between April 2004 and March 2006. Home ranges showed a high proportion of 90{\textendash}120 year-old forests, a low proportion of regenerating forests (20{\textendash}40 years old) and a tendency to include a greater proportion of 6{\textendash}20 year-old clearcuts in relation to their availability in the study area. At the home range scale, selection patterns differed between periods, possibly reflecting specific requirements linked to caribou life cycle. Caribou selected open lichen woodlands throughout the year while mature closed forests (!50 years) were selected uniquely during summer. The 6{\textendash}20 year-old clearcuts were avoided during calving, in summer and during the rutting period but were selected during spring. Our results indicate that mature forest and open lichen woodlands are highly selected forest cover types by caribou at both spatial scales. Although clearcuts were generally avoided at the home range scale, such avoidance was not observed at the larger scale, the search for 90{\textendash}120 year-old forests being hampered by a uniform distribution of clearcuts. An a posteriori landscape analysis highlighted the spatial association between 6{\textendash}20 year-old clearcuts and 90{\textendash}120 year-old forests, an association that can be explained by the current regulations used in Que{\textasciiacute} bec. Our results underline the importance of pursuing research concerning the impact of such an exploitation regime on the long-term maintenance of the forest caribou in the boreal landscape.},

Coral bleaching occurs when the thermal tolerance of corals and their photosynthetic symbionts (zooxanthellae) is exceeded. Mass coral bleaching has occurred in association with episodes of elevated sea temperatures over the past 20 years and involves the loss of the zooxanthellae following chronic photoinhibition. Mass bleaching has resulted in significant losses of live coral in many parts of the world. This paper considers the biochemical, physiological and ecological perspectives of coral bleaching. It also uses the outputs of four runs from three models of global climate change which simulate changes in sea temperature and hence how the frequency and intensity of bleaching events will change over the next 100 years. The results suggest that the thermal tolerances of reef-building corals are likely to be exceeded every year within the next few decades. Events as severe as the 1998 event, the worst on record, are likely to become commonplace within 20 years. Most information suggests that the capacity for acclimation by corals has already been exceeded, and that adaptation will be too slow to avert a decline in the quality of the world's reefs. The rapidity of the changes that are predicted indicates a major problem for tropical marine ecosystems and suggests that unrestrained warming cannot occur without the loss and degradation of coral reefs on a global scale.},

  abstract = {Dispersal is a basic feature of the natural history of moose. Most information about moose dispersal pertains to short-distance movements because long-distance movements are uncommon and difficult to observe. Since the 1950s, moose populations have been increasing in Minnesota and North Dakota. This may have contributed to several long-distance dispersal events for moose that recently were reported in the central United States. These dispersal events provide an opportunity to investigate both the causes and the biological implications of this rare phenomenon. Herein, we review long-distance dispersal events based on information obtained from a variety of sources. Dispersal routes that could be measured included two with minimal distances of 1,511 and 367 km, plus several others that were shorter. These dispersal events and recent evidence of moose reproducing outside the current range of the species could be the result of increasing population trends of moose in the central United States. We suggest that the dispersing moose are founder individuals that are dispersing naturally from established populations in search of suitable habitats and mates in areas to the south. We hypothesize that this type of geographic range expansion is similar to that of moose when they dispersed across North America during the early Holocene. As moose continue to move south, wildlife managers should be aware of habitats within their respective states that might sustain populations of moose.},

Estimated mean values for lichen intake as determined by the 3 methods were 16.4, 31.6, and 61.3 g/day of dry lichen per kg body weight or approximately 1.3, 2.5, and 4.9 kg/day dry lichen for an 80-kg reindeer or caribou. The 4-fold range in lichen intake estimates may be attributed to differences in environmental exposures inherent in the methods. Penned reindeer were necessarily sedentary without the stresses and activities normally associated with free-grazing animals. Esophageal fistulated reindeer were required to obtain forage for themselves. However, they were tethered or protected and therefore not subjected to influences such as migration or harassment by predators. The fallout radiocesium method is unique in that it does not affect the normal activity of the animal and thus has the potential for determining the most realistic estimate of lichen intake for an animal in the natural system. The forage intake rates in terms of metabolizable energy available to reindeer and caribou are compared to the probable energy requirements of the animals.},

  abstract = {Most species have one or more natural enemies, e.g., predators, parasites, pathogens, and herbivores, among others. These species in turn typically attack multiple victim species. This leads to the possibility of indirect interactions among those victims, both positive and negative. The term apparent competition commonly denotes negative indirect interactions between victim species that arise because they share a natural enemy. This indirect interaction, which in principle can be reflected in many facets of the distribution and abundance of individual species and more broadly govern the structure of ecological communities in time and space, pervades many natural ecosystems. It also is a central theme in many applied ecological problems, including the control of agricultural pests, harvesting, the conservation of endangered species, and the dynamics of emerging diseases. At one end of the scale of life, apparent competition characterizes intriguing aspects of dynamics within individual organisms{\textemdash}for example, the immune system is akin in many ways to a predator that can induce negative indirect interactions among different pathogens. At intermediate scales of biological organization, the existence and strength of apparent competition depend upon many contingent details of individual behavior and life history, as well as the community and spatial context within which indirect interactions play out. At the broadest scale of macroecology and macroevolution, apparent competition may play a major, if poorly understood, role in the evolution of species' geographical ranges and adaptive radiations.},

  abstract = {The construction of a network capturing the topological structure linked to the interactions among species and the analysis of its properties constitutes a clarifying way to understand the functioning of an ecosystem at different scales of analysis. Here, we present a novel systematic procedure to profit from the enhanced information derived from considering its multiple levels and apply it to analyse the presence of keystone species. The proposed method presents a way to unveil the information stored in a network by comparing it to some randomised modification of itself. The randomising of the original network is done by swapping a controlled number of links while preserving the degree of the nodes. Then, we compare the modularity value of the original network with the randomised counterparts, which gives us a measure of the amount of relevant information stored in the first one. Once we have verified that the modularity value is meaningful, we use it to perform a community analysis and a characterisation of other topological properties in order to identify keystone species. We applied this method to a pollinator{\textendash}plant{\textendash}herbivore trophic network as a case study and we found that (a) the comparison between the modularity of the original and the randomised networks is a suitable tool to detect relevant information; and (b) identifying keystone species yields different results in bipartite networks from the ones obtained in networks of more than two trophic levels. We also analysed the effect of eliminating selected species from the system on the cohesion of the network. The selection of these species was made according to the centralities values, such as degree and betweenness, of the corresponding nodes. Our findings show that our analysis, mainly based on the measure of modularity is a reliable tool to characterise ecological networks. Additionally, we argue that since degree and betweenness are not always correlated, it is more reliable to measure both in an attempt to detect keystone species. The methodology proposed here to identify keystone species can be applied to other ecological networks currently available in the literature.},

The results are a beginning toward answering some of the theoretical questions presented to population ecologists. The present data indicate that if an adequate environment is encompassed, the predator-prey relation is not necessarily self-annihilative, and that absolutely restrictive refuges are not essential. The results also support the view that more stable control of a population is likely to result in an environment of balanced heterogeneity than in one of simpler structure. In this study a predator-prey relation was maintained for three successive oscillation waves before overexploitation finally ended the relation in the most complex universe or ecosystem utilized. Some of the questions which may ultimately be answered by such studies include: Are such oscillations inherently of increasing amplitude? If so, are there commonly present forces which act to cancel this tendency? Does the presence of other significant species in addition to the two original coactors tend to stabilize or disturb the relation? What may be the effect of changes in the physical conditions upon the degree of stability or permanence of the relation? Can evidence be obtained regarding the concept that the prey, as well as the predator, may benefit from the relation? What is the order of influence on stability of such factors as shelter, food, disease, and natural enemies of other kinds?},

  abstract = {A framework for the description and analysis of multilayer networks is established in statistical physics, and calls are increasing for their adoption by community ecologists. Multilayer networks in community ecology will allow space, time and multiple interaction types to be incorporated into species interaction networks. While the multilayer network framework is applicable to ecological questions, it is one thing to be able to describe ecological communities as multilayer networks and another for multilayer networks to actually prove useful for answering ecological questions. Importantly, documenting multilayer network structure requires substantially greater empirical investment than standard ecological networks. In response, we argue that this additional effort is worthwhile and describe a series of research lines where we expect multilayer networks will generate the greatest impact. Inter-layer edges are the key component that differentiate multilayer networks from standard ecological networks. Inter-layer edges join different networks{\textemdash}termed layers{\textemdash}together and represent ecological processes central to the species interactions studied (e.g., inter-layer edges representing movement for networks separated in space). Inter-layer edges may take a variety of forms, be species- or network-specific, and be measured with a large suite of empirical techniques. Additionally, the sheer size of ecological multilayer networks also requires some changes to empirical data collection around interaction quantification, collaborative efforts and collation in public databases. Network ecology has already touched on a wide swath of ecology and evolutionary biology. Because network stability and patterns of species linkage are the most developed areas of network ecology, they are a natural starting place for multilayer investigations. However, multilayer networks will also provide novel insights to niche partitioning, the connection between traits and species' interactions, and even the geographic mosaic of co-evolution. Synthesis. Multilayer networks provide a formal way to bring together the study of species interaction networks and the processes that influence them. However, describing inter-layer edges and the increasing amounts of data required represent challenges. The pay-off for added investment will be ecological networks that describe the composition and capture the dynamics of ecological communities more completely and, consequently, have greater power for understanding the patterns and processes that underpin diversity in ecological communities.

Seasonal migrations are a key component of Arctic food webs that still elude current theories predicting a single community equilibrium. We develop a multi-season model of predator{\textendash}prey dynamics using a hybrid dynamical systems framework applied to a simplified tundra food web (lemming{\textendash}fox{\textendash}goose{\textendash}owl). Hybrid systems models can accommodate multiple equilibria, which is a basic requirement for modelling food webs whose topology changes with season. We demonstrate that our model can generate multi-annual cycling in lemming dynamics, solely from a combined effect of seasonality and state-dependent behaviour. We compare our multi-season model to a static model of the predator{\textendash}prey community dynamics and study the interactions between species. Interestingly, including seasonality reveals indirect interactions between migrants and residents not captured by the static model. Further, we find that the direction and magnitude of interactions between two species are not necessarily accurate using only summer time-series. Our study demonstrates the need for the development of multi-season models and provides the tools to analyse them. Integrating seasonality in food web modelling is a vital step to improve predictions about the impacts of climate change on ecosystem functioning.

The capacity to forecast how species respond to such press perturbations is limited by our imprecise knowledge of pairwise species interaction strengths and the many direct and indirect pathways along which perturbations can propagate between species. Network complexity (size and connectance) has thereby been seen to limit the predictability of ecological systems. Here we demonstrate a counteracting mechanism in which the influence of indirect effects declines with increasing network complexity when species interactions are governed by universal allometric constraints. With these constraints, network size and connectance interact to produce a skewed distribution of interaction strengths whose skew becomes more pronounced with increasing complexity. Together, the increased prevalence of weak interactions and the increased relative strength and rarity of strong interactions in complex networks limit disturbance propagation and preserve the qualitative predictability of net effects even when pairwise interaction strengths exhibit substantial variation or uncertainty.},

Global positioning system clusters were more likely to be wolf kill sites when they had a higher number of location fixes, did not begin within 300 m and 30 days of a previous cluster, did not begin within 1 km and 4 days of a previous cluster, began in the evening, had a high percentage of fixes occurring during the day, occurred farther from open habitat, and had both a high number of location fixes and a high percentage of fixes occurring during the day. Our results highlight the limits of using spatio-temporal clusters with a fix rate of 1/hour to discriminate wolf kill sites in systems dominated by deer (Odocoileus spp.) because of the associated short handling time with these prey. Global positioning system (GPS) clusters are not ubiquitously successful in identifying wolf kill sites. Small biomass of prey individuals hampers the effectiveness of using spatio-temporal characteristics of GPS clusters to reliably identify where wolves have killed prey.},

Here we summarize 3 decades of North American moose (Alces alces) population and harvest densities collected at the management unit scale for the years 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010. A summary analysis of these data indicates that moose have both expanded and contracted along their southern range boundary in recent decades - including the Prairie Provinces and states, and a portion of the northeastern United States. A narrow band of relatively stable and high-density moose populations extends from central Alaska across the Prairie Provinces and east to the Maritime Provinces and upper northeastern states. Distributions in 2010 indicate that moose now occupy an area {$>$} 9,492,000 km2 in North America. We also identified that a core range of boreal habitat, only 30\% of the occupied range across the continent, supports 89\% of the estimated 1 million moose in North America. Time-series analyses can offer a simple and cost-effective approach to monitor the status of moose populations in North America, and might be particularly insightful given the current and predicted future influences of climate change on moose. Other analyses might address population dynamics, habitat, environmental constraints, and harvest management, among other issues. We encourage jurisdictions to cooperate strategically in implementing and coordinating GIS analyses to monitor, assess, and manage the North American moose population.},

Different from traditional Filippov models, here, we incorporate time delay as to account for predator maturity time. The stability of the equilibria and the existence of Hopf bifurcation of the subsystems are investigated. Moreover, sliding mode dynamics and regular/virtual/pseudoequilibria are analyzed. Numerical simulations indicate that all solutions finally converge to either the regular equilibrium, the pseudoequilibrium or a stable periodic solution according to different values of time delays and threshold levels. A boundary bifurcation that switches a stable regular equilibrium or a stable limit cycle to a stable pseudoequilibrium can occur. Meanwhile, global bifurcations from the standard periodic solution to the sliding switching bifurcation and then to the crossing bifurcation are obtained as time delay is increased. The results show that Filippov control strategies could effectively control the number of pests under the prescribed threshold, however, time delay may challenge pest control by the occurring of the sliding switching and crossing bifurcations.},

More appropriate might be to use logistic regression to estimate a resource selection function (RSF) tied to a use-availability design based on independent samples drawn from used and available resource units. We review the theoretical motivation for RSFs and show that sample "contamination" and the exponential form commonly assumed for the RSF are not concerns, contrary to recent statements by Keating and Cherry (2004; Use and interpretation of logistic regression in habitat-selection studies. Journal of Wildlife Management 68:774-789). To do this, we re-derive the use-availability likelihood and show that it can be maximized by logistic regression software. We then consider 2 case studies that illustrate our findings. For our first case study, we fit both RSFs and resource selection probability functions (RSPF) to point count data for 4 bird species with varying levels of occurrence among sample blocks. Drawing on our new derivation of the likelihood, we sample available resource units with replacement and assume overlapping distributions of used and available resource units. Irrespective of overlap, we observed approximate proportionality between predictions of a RSF and RSPF. For our second case study, we evaluate the classic use-availability design suggested by Manly et al. (2002), where availability is sampled without replacement, and we systematically introduce contamination to a sample of available units applied to RSFs for woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). Although contamination appeared to reduce the magnitude of one RSF beta coefficient, change in magnitude exceeded sampling variation only when {$>$}20\% of the available units were confirmed caribou use locations (i.e., contaminated). These empirically based simulations suggest that previously recommended sampling designs are robust to contamination. We conclude with a new validation method for evaluating predictive performance of a RSF and for assessing if the model deviates from being proportional to the probability of use of a resource unit.}

Understanding habitat quality for birds is crucial for ecologists and managers, but few papers have explored the advantages and disadvantages of different ways to measure it. In this review I clarify terminology and distinguish habitat quality from related terms, differentiate habitat quality at the levels of individual birds and populations, and describe different field methods for measuring habitat quality. As much as feasible, biologists concerned with habitat quality should emphasize demographic variables while recognizing that reproduction, survival, and abundance may not all be positively correlated. The distribution of birds can also reveal habitat quality (e.g., through patterns of habitat selection), but researchers should first investigate how closely their subjects follow ideal distributions because numerous ecological factors can lead birds to select poor and avoid rich habitats. Measures of body condition can provide convenient measures of habitat quality, but to be useful they must be a consequence, rather than a cause, of habitat selection. Habitat ecologists should use caution before relying on shortcuts from more labor-intensive demographic work. To increase the reliability of our habitat quality measurements, we should work to develop new methods to assess critical assumptions of nondemographic indicators, such as whether birds follow ideal distributions under natural conditions and whether spatial variation in body condition manifests in differential fitness.},

We tested a technique that uses resource selection functions (RSF) to scale animal density to the relative probability of selecting a patch of habitat. Following an accurate survey of a reference block, the habitat-based density estimator can be used to predict population abundance for other areas with no or unreliable survey data. We parameterized and tested the technique using multiple years of radiotelemetry locations and survey data collected for woodland caribou across four landscape-level survey blocks. The habitat-based density estimator performed poorly. Predictions were no better than those of a simple area estimator and in some cases deviated from the observed by a factor of 10. We developed a simulation model to investigate factors that might influence prediction success. We experimentally manipulated population density, caribou distribution, ability of animals to track carrying capacity, and precision of the estimation equation. Our simulations suggested that interactions between population density, the size of the reference block, and the pattern of distribution can lead to large discrepancies between observed and predicted population numbers. Over- or undermatching patch carrying capacity and precision of the estimator can influence predictions, but the effect is much less extreme. Although there is some empirical and theoretical evidence to support a relationship between animal abundance and resource selection, our study suggests that a number of factors can seriously confound these relationships. Habitat-based density estimators might be effective where a stable, isolated population at equilibrium is used to generate predictions for areas with similar population parameters and ecological conditions.},

Furthermore, we prove that a maximally coherent network with constant interaction strengths will always be linearly stable. We also propose a simple model that, by correctly capturing the trophic coherence of food webs, accurately reproduces their stability and other basic structural features. Most remarkably, our model shows that stability can increase with size and complexity. This suggests a key to May's paradox, and a range of opportunities and concerns for biodiversity conservation.},

There is debate about the efficacy of the practice, but more controversial is the ethical justification and methods of killing one species in favor of another. This is the situation facing the conservation of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in Canada. Across multiple jurisdictions, large numbers of wolves (Canis lupus), and to a lesser extent bears (Ursus americanus) and coyotes (C. latrans), are killed through trapping, poisoning or aerial shooting to halt or reverse continued declines of woodland caribou. While there is evidence to support the effectiveness of predator management as a stop-gap solution, questions remain about the extent to which this activity can make a meaningful contribution to long-term recovery. Also, there are myriad ethical objections to the lethal removal of predators, even if that activity is in the name of conservation. Debates about predator management, just one of numerous invasive actions for maintaining caribou, are made even more complex by the conflation of ethics and efficacy. Ultimately, long-term solutions for the recovery of caribou require governments to stop delaying difficult decisions that address the real causes of population decline, habitat change.},

We tested the effect of pelt price (adjusted to 1986-equivalent Canadian dollars), number of trappers, and bison (Bison bison) population size on wolf pelt returns for an 18-year period using a multiple linear regression model. We then tested the relationship between wolf sightings on survey flights and bison population size for an overlapping 19-year period. Wolf pelt price was a significant determinant of wolf harvest, whereas numbers of bison or trappers were not significant predictors of wolf harvest. However, there was a significant relationship between wolf sightings and bison population size. This analysis suggests that wolf population size was correlated with bison numbers, similar to the numerical response seen in other wolf-prey systems.},

The `mixed' scale gives the most consistent results, suggesting that predation should be measured for each pack, but that packs share all moose on the island. On this scale, the functional response is clearly ratio-dependent.},

  abstract = {Climate change can impact ecosystems by reshaping the dynamics of resource exploitation for predators and their prey. Alterations of these pathways could be especially intense in ecosystems characterized by a simple trophic structure and rapid warming trends, such as in the Arctic. However, quantifying the multiple direct and indirect pathways through which climate change is likely to alter trophic interactions and their relative strength remains a challenge. Here, we aim to identify direct and indirect causal mechanisms driven by climate affecting predator{\textendash}prey interactions of species sharing a tundra food web. We based our study on relationships between one Arctic predator (Arctic fox) and its two main prey {\textendash} lemmings (preferred prey) and snow geese (alternate prey) {\textendash} which are exposed to variable local and regional climatic factors across years. We used a combination of models mapping multiple causal links among key variables derived from a long-term dataset (21 years). We obtained several possible scenarios linking regional climate factors (Arctic oscillations) and local temperature and precipitation to the breeding of species. Our results suggest that both regional and local climate factors have direct and indirect impacts on the breeding of foxes and geese. Local climate showed a positive causal link with goose nesting success, while both regional and local climate displayed contrasted effects on the proportion of fox breeding. We found no impact of climate on lemming abundance. We observed positive relationships between lemming, fox and goose reproduction highlighting numerical and functional responses of fox to the variability of lemming abundance. Our study measures causal links and strength of interactions in a food web, quantifying both numerical response of a predator and apparent interactions between its two main prey. These results improve our understanding of the complex effects of climate on predator{\textendash}prey interactions and our capacity to anticipate food web response to ongoing climate change.},

Today's conservation science incorporates conservation biology into a broader interdisciplinary field that explicitly recognizes the tight coupling of social and natural systems. Emerging priorities include pursuing conservation within working landscapes, rebuilding public support, working with the corporate sector, and paying better attention to human rights and equity. We argue that in conservation, strategies must be promoted that simultaneously maximize the preservation of biodiversity and the improvement of human well-being.},

The Svalbard Archipelago, situated at 780 North, and 150 East, is a hotspot for climate change in the arctic, and my study was in the Adventdalen valley of the island. According to climate models, the average annual temperature will increase by about 100C, while the autumn temperature will increase between 7-100C by 2100. My study was an experiment manipulating temperature (open top chambers in combination with heaters elevating temperature by ca. 2 and 7 degrees) and moisture (dry and wet) to investigate their impact on rate of senescence in autumn in three Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrynchus) forage species. The three species also constitute the three dominant growth forms in Svalbard. Alopecurus borealis represented graminoids, Bistorta vivipara represented forbs, and Salix polaris represented shrubs. It was a transplant experiment to a garden with 12 plots. Counts of green and brown shoots/ leaves were done for about six weeks in late summer-autumn, beginning in mid-August to the end of September when freezing occurred. I found that the graminoid delayed the rate of senescence with higher temperature and moisture. The forb was not affected by moisture but showed a moderate delay in rate of senescence with higher temperatures, while neither moisture nor temperature affected the autumn phenology of the shrub. My analysis shows contradictory results to various other studies that have suggested a greening arctic due to shrubification in the arctic tundra. Graminoids may be the winners of climate change effects in autumn and may affect herbivores positively, by increasing their autumn food quality. Therefore, warmer, and wetter autumns may counteract the effects of harsh winters and propagate the reproductive success of the Svalbard reindeer. As capital breeders, Svalbard reindeer may access higher quality and quantity of vegetation late into autumn and pack fat reserves for over-wintering. My study is just the beginning of a journey toward understanding the link between food availability in autumn and the enhanced fitness of the Svalbard reindeer.},

  abstract = {Investigations of compound disturbances that alter forest resilience (i.e., recovery time or trajectory) have escalated over the past two decades. We used a systematic approach to identify and describe the ecological consequences of discrete forest disturbance events involved in compound interactions. Fire, wind disturbance, and salvage logging were the most common disturbance types investigated. Most compound interactions occurred in North America and involved five or fewer years between disturbances. Common and interrelated disturbance legacies that facilitated compound interactions included reduced seed source availability, deadwood deposition and extraction, and increased light and growing space availability. Forest recovery was assessed with a diversity of metrics including woody and herbaceous plants, soil properties, and carbon stocks, which sometimes determined whether and what kind of compound interaction was detected. Distinctions between recovery time and trajectory, forest succession and development, and species-specific and community-level responses also influenced the detection and direction of compound interactions. Moving forward, we advocate a more holistic approach to quantify ecosystem recovery that considers multiple response variables. Other opportunities to improve compound disturbance ecology include increased emphasis on understudied disturbance types, regions, and forest types. We also encourage more research on buffering interactions that increase forest resilience, which were underrepresented in this review.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The alternative prey hypothesis describes the mechanism for apparent competition whereby the mortality of the secondary prey species increases (and population size decreases decreases) by the increased predation by the shared predator if the population size of the primary prey decreases. Apparent competition is a process where the abundance of two co-existing prey species are negatively associated because they share a mutual predator, which negatively affects the abundance of both prey Here, we examined whether alternative prey and/or apparent competition hypothesis can explain the population dynamics and reproductive output of the secondary prey, wild forest reindeer (Rangifer tarandus fennicus) in Finland, in a predator-prey community in which moose (Alces alces) is the primary prey and the wolf (Canis lupus) is the generalist predator. METHODS: We examined a 22-year time series (1996-2017) to determine how the population size and the calf/female ratio of wild forest reindeer in Eastern Finland were related to the abundances of wolf and moose. Only moose population size was regulated by hunting. Summer predation of wolves on reindeer focuses on calves. We used least squares regression (GLS) models (for handling autocorrelated error structures and resulting pseudo-R2s) and generalized linear mixed (GLMs) models (for avoidance of negative predictions) to determine the relationships between abundances. We performed linear and general linear models for the calf/female ratio of reindeer. RESULTS AND SYNTHESIS: The trends in reindeer population size and moose abundance were almost identical: an increase during the first years and then a decrease until the last years of our study period. Wolf population size in turn did not show long-term trends. Change in reindeer population size between consecutive winters was related positively to the calf/female ratio. The calf/female ratio was negatively related to wolf population size, but the reindeer population size was related to the wolf population only when moose abundance was entered as another independent variable. The wolf population was not related to moose abundance even though it is likely to consist the majority of the prey biomass. Because reindeer and moose populations were positively associated, our results seemed to support the alternative prey hypothesis more than the apparent competition hypothesis. However, these two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive and the primary mechanism is difficult to distinguish as the system is heavily managed by moose hunting. The recovery of wild forest reindeer in eastern Finland probably requires ecosystem management involving both habitat restoration and control of species abundances.},

Among the fastest moving species are boreal generalist fish which are expected to affect arctic marine food web structure and ecosystem functioning substantially. Here, we address structural changes at the food web level induced by poleward shifts via topological network analysis of highly resolved boreal and arctic food webs of the Barents Sea. We detected considerable differences in structural properties and link configuration between the boreal and the arctic food webs, the latter being more modular and less connected. We found that a main characteristic of the boreal fish moving poleward into the arctic region of the Barents Sea is high generalism, a property that increases connectance and reduces modularity in the arctic marine food web. Our results reveal that habitats form natural boundaries for food web modules, and that generalists play an important functional role in coupling pelagic and benthic modules. We posit that these habitat couplers have the potential to promote the transfer of energy and matter between habitats, but also the spread of pertubations, thereby changing arctic marine food web structure considerably with implications for ecosystem dynamics and functioning.},

Here, we investigated how spatial patterns in food-web structure are associated with environmental gradients in the Barents Sea, a highly productive shelf sea of the Arctic Ocean. We compared food webs from 25 subregions in the Barents Sea and examined spatial correlations among food-web metrics, and between metrics and spatial variability in seawater temperature, bottom depth and number of days with ice cover. Several food-web metrics were positively associated with seawater temperature: connectance, level of omnivory, clustering, cannibalism, and high variability in generalism, while other food-web metrics such as modularity and vulnerability were positively associated with sea ice and negatively with temperature. Food-web metrics positively associated with habitat heterogeneity were: number of species, link density, omnivory, path length, and trophic level. This finding suggests that habitat heterogeneity promotes food-web complexity in terms of number of species and link density. Our analyses reveal that spatial variation in food-web structure along the environmental gradients is partly related to species turnover. However, the higher interaction turnover compared to species turnover along these gradients indicates a consistent modification of food-web structure, implying that interacting species may co-vary in space. In conclusion, our study shows how environmental heterogeneity, via environmental filtering, influences not only turnover in species composition, but also the structure of food webs over large spatial scales.},

  abstract = {In temperate forests of the northeastern U.S., moose (Alces alces) populations are adapted for mixed-age heterogeneous landscapes that provide abundant herbaceous forage in warm months and coniferous forage during winter. Heterogeneity of forest stands is driven by management activities or natural disturbance, resulting in a multi-age forest at a landscape scale. Here, we present a method to estimate landscape carrying capacity of moose by combining remote sensing classification of forest cover class with literature or field-based estimates of class-specific forage abundance. We used Landsat imagery from 1991 to 2013 for the Allegheny National Forest and 2013{\textendash}2018 for the Adirondack Park, and associated training polygons, to predict based on NDVI and SWI whether a forested landscape fit into one of three cover classes: mature forest, intermediate timber removal, or overstory timber removal. Our three-classes yielded a mean land cover prediction accuracy of 94.3\% (Khat = 0.91) and 86.9\% (Khat = 0.76) for ANFR and AP, respectively. In the AP, we applied previously calculated summer crude protein values to our predicted cover types, resulting in an estimated average carrying capacity of 760 moose (SD {$\pm$} 428) across all sampling years, similar in magnitude to a density estimate of 716 moose (95\% CI = 566{\textendash}906) calculated during the same time. Our approach was able to accurately identify forest timber treatments across landscapes at differing spatial and temporal scales and provide an alternative method to estimate landscape-level ungulate carrying capacity. The ability to accurately identify areas of potential conflict from overbrowsing, or to highlight areas in need of land cover treatments can increase the toolset for ungulate management in managed forest landscapes.},

A body of knowledge exists relating these traits to evolutionary pressures. In this study, we formalize this knowledge into general mathematical assumptions, and use them in an ecoevolutionary model. In contrast to previous models, this study novelty accounts for both traits{\textemdash}arrival date and hatching date{\textemdash}and the interdependence between them, revealing when one, the other or both will respond to climate. For all models sharing the assumptions, the following phenological responses will occur. First, if the nestling-prey peak is late enough, hatching is synchronous with, and arrival date evolves independently of, prey phenology. Second, when resource availability constrains the length of the pre-laying period, hatching is adaptively asynchronous with prey phenology. Predictions for both traits compare well with empirical observations. In response to advancing prey phenology, arrival date may advance, remain unchanged, or even become delayed; the latter occurring when egg-laying resources are only available relatively late in the season. The model shows that asynchronous hatching and unresponsive arrival date are not sufficient evidence that phenological adaptation is constrained. The work provides a framework for exploring microevolution of interdependent phenological traits.},

  abstract = {Ecologists are challenged by the need to bridge and synthesize different approaches and theories to obtain a coherent understanding of ecosystems in a changing world. Both food web theory and regime shift theory shine light on mechanisms that confer stability to ecosystems, but from different angles. Empirical food web models are developed to analyze how equilibria in real multi-trophic ecosystems are shaped by species interactions, and often include linear functional response terms for simple estimation of interaction strengths from observations. Models of regime shifts focus on qualitative changes of equilibrium points in a slowly changing environment, and typically include non-linear functional response terms. Currently, it is unclear how the stability of an empirical food web model, expressed as the rate of system recovery after a small perturbation, relates to the vulnerability of the ecosystem to collapse. Here, we conduct structural sensitivity analyses of classical consumer-resource models in equilibrium along an environmental gradient. Specifically, we change non-proportional interaction terms into proportional ones, while maintaining the equilibrium biomass densities and material flux rates, to analyze how alternative model formulations shape the stability properties of the equilibria. The results reveal no consistent relationship between the stability of the original models and the proportionalized versions, even though they describe the same biomass values and material flows. We use these findings to critically discuss whether stability analysis of observed equilibria by empirical food web models can provide insight into regime shift dynamics, and highlight the challenge of bridging alternative modelling approaches in ecology and beyond.},

This work studies the stability of populations when one or more communication links is removed. An example is finding the alignment of a highway through a patched forest containing a network of metapopulations in the patches. This problem is modelled as that of finding a stable cut of the graph induced by the metapopulations network, where nodes represent the habitat patches and the weighted edges model the dispersal between habitat patches. A reaction{\textendash}diffusion system on the graph models the dynamics of the predator{\textendash}prey system over the patched ecological network. The graph Laplacian's Fiedler value, which indicates the well-connectedness of the graph, is shown to affect the stability of the metapopulations. We show that, when the Fiedler value is sufficiently large, the removal of edges without destabilizing the dynamics of the network is possible. We give an exhaustive graph partitioning procedure, which is suitable for smaller networks and uses the criterion for both the local and global stability of populations in partitioned networks. A heuristic graph bisection algorithm that preserves the preassigned lower bound for the Fiedler value is proposed for larger networks and is illustrated with examples.},

  abstract = {The focus of the work was to investigate dependency between reindeer density and lichen (Cladonia spp.) ranges in the Finnish semidomesticated reindeer management area. Secondly, we formed a model on the recovery rate of ungrazed woodland lichen ranges (29 sites) after forest fires to evaluate the potential productivity and time needed for Finnish lichen ranges to recover at optimal production. During 1974 {\textendash} 95, 59\% of the variation in mean semidomesticated reindeer density (range: 0.7{\textendash}3.0 reindeer/km2 of the total land area) among the reindeer herding districts in Finland was explained by the proportion of land area covered by lichen ranges in these districts. Reindeer densities were highest in the districts where lichen ranges covered 20\% to 30\% of the area. Reindeer density on the total land area did not explain the condition of lichen ranges, but 58\% of the condition was explained by the reindeer density on the lichen ranges. A condition level for lichen ranges of 1000 kg dry matter per hectare (d.m./ha) of lichen biomass can be considered adequate to ensure survival of reindeer and continued production of lichen. To maintain this level within the sedentary Finnish grazing system, winter reindeer densities on lichen ranges must remain below 5{\textendash}7 reindeer/km2. According to our model, the maximum amount of living lichen in the woodland lichen stand at the climax stage is on average about 7000 kg d.m./ha. The maximum annual yield of lichen (175 kg d.m./ha) is produced by lichen stands that contain 2600{\textendash}2800 kg d.m./ha of living lichen. Using our model and our 1995 {\textendash} 96 data, we calculated that the average lichen biomass on lichen ranges in the Finnish reindeer management districts was 13.0\% of this optimum, and the average lichen production was 36\% of the possible maximum annual yield. Our model indicates that the Finnish lichen ranges would have to remain ungrazed for an average of 18 years to recover to maximum production levels. However, the average time needed for the lichen ranges to recover to the level of 1000 kg lichen d.m./ha, would be only about 7 years.},

To better understand changes in moose populations coinciding with this period of declining harvest, we modelled population dynamics within 31 Game Management Zones (GMZs). We used aerial survey data (180 density and 159 composition surveys) combined with licensed harvest to develop 4 competing statistical models to assess population dynamics based on constant parameters and temporal trends in calf:cow ratios at 6 months, \-juvenile survival from 6{\textendash}18 months, or cow survival. The models indicated that moose populations declined ({$\lambda$} {$<$} 1) in 7 GMZs (23\%) from 1996{\textendash}2005 and in 22 GMZs (71\%) from 2006{\textendash}2015. Over the 20-year period, the best model was fit with declining trends in calf:cow ratios in 8 GMZs, declining juvenile survival in 6 GMZs, and declining cow survival in 8 GMZs. Population growth rate was slightly reduced in those GMZs where licenced antlerless (cow and calf) hunting occurred but was not considered the primary factor causing population decline. Total licenced bull harvest influenced bull:cow ratios that were significantly lower in 2006{\textendash}2015 (x = 37:100) than 1995{\textendash}2005 (x = 48:100); significant predictive relationships existed between harvest rates and bull:cow ratios. Provincial moose numbers and harvest were highly correlated (r = 0.81) suggesting that declining harvest was a reaction to declining population trends. We found that the provincial moose population increased 6\% from 1996{\textendash}2005, subsequently declined 32\% from 2006{\textendash}2015, and declined 29\% overall during the 20-year study period.},

We demonstrate how the impact of insects on forest structure and composition can reverberate across trophic levels by altering apparent competition in a large-mammal food web subjected to timber extraction. Spruce budworm outbreaks initiated a flush in deciduous vegetation that benefited moose, which translated into apparent competition between moose and boreal caribou through wolf predation. Mortality risk of caribou became indirectly related to patterns of insect and human activities, with the ungulate experiencing higher risk when selecting stands severely infested by budworms and subsequently logged. We expose cascading effects of insect{\textendash}forest interactions on large-mammal relations in human-altered ecosystems.           ,                             While the important role of animal-mediated interactions in the top-down restructuring of plant communities is well documented, less is known of their ensuing repercussions at higher trophic levels. We demonstrate how typically decoupled ecological interactions may become intertwined such that the impact of an insect pest on forest structure and composition alters predator{\textendash}prey interactions among large mammals. Specifically, we show how irruptions in a common, cyclic insect pest of the boreal forest, the spruce budworm (               Choristoneura fumiferana               ), modulated an indirect trophic interaction by initiating a flush in deciduous vegetation that benefited moose (               Alces alces               ), in turn strengthening apparent competition between moose and threatened boreal caribou (               Rangifer tarandus caribou               ) via wolf (               Canis lupus               ) predation.

Wolves were radio tracked daily during early February and March to locate kills. The estimated kill rate was 0.019 moose/wolf/day (95\% CI: 0.011-0.028). This estimate was intermediary relative to previous work. The management implications of this result are discussed.},

Nevertheless, our lives are strongly based on services provided by ecosystems, thus the responses to global change of our natural heritage are of immediate concern. Understanding the relationship between complexity and stability of ecosystems is of key importance for the maintenance of the balance of human growth and the conservation of all the natural services that ecosystems provide. Mathematical network models can be used to simplify the vast complexity of the real world, to formally describe and investigate ecological phenomena, and to understand ecosystems propensity of returning to its functioning regime after a stress or a perturbation. The use of ecological-network models to study the relationship between complexity and stability of natural ecosystems is the focus of this review. The concept of ecological networks and their characteristics are first introduced, followed by central and occasionally contrasting definitions of complexity and stability. The literature on the relationship between complexity and stability in different types of models and in real ecosystems is then reviewed, highlighting the theoretical debate and the lack of consensual agreement. The summary of the importance of this line of research for the successful management and conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services concludes the review.},

  abstract = {Population increases of primary prey can negatively impact alternate prey populations via demographic and behavioural responses of a shared predator through apparent competition. Seasonal variation in prey selection patterns by predators also can affect secondary and incidental prey by reducing spatial separation. Global warming and landscape changes in Alberta's bitumen sands have resulted in prey enrichment, which is changing the large mammal predator{\textendash}prey system and causing declines in woodland caribou Rangifer tarandus caribou populations. We assessed seasonal patterns of prey use and spatial selection by wolves Canis lupus in two woodland caribou ranges in northeastern Alberta, Canada, that have undergone prey enrichment following recent white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus invasion. We determined whether risk of predation for caribou (incidental prey) and the proportion of wolf-caused-caribou mortalities varied with season. We found that wolves showed seasonal variation in primary prey use, with deer and beaver Castor canadensis being the most common prey items in wolf diet in winter and summer, respectively. These seasonal dietary patterns were reflected in seasonal wolf spatial resource selection and resulted in contrasting spatial relationships between wolves and caribou. During winter, wolf selection for areas used by deer maintained strong spatial separation between wolves and caribou, whereas wolf selection for areas used by beaver in summer increased the overlap with caribou. Changing patterns in wolf resource selection were reflected by caribou mortality patterns, with 76.2\% of 42 adult female caribou mortalities occurring in summer. Understanding seasonal patterns of predation following prey enrichment in a multiprey system is essential when assessing the effect of predation on an incidental prey species. Our results support the conclusion that wolves are proximately responsible for woodland caribou population declines throughout much of their range.},

Pour cela, cette th{\`e}se pr{\'e}sente la conception d'un mod{\`e}le centr{\'e} sur l'individu des d{\'e}placements de ces trois esp{\`e}ces en fonction de leur environnement, dont r{\'e}sulteront les interactions pr{\'e}dateur-proies. Afin de permettre l'application de ce mod{\`e}le sur de longues p{\'e}riodes, et donc pour un environnement changeant, une m{\'e}thodologie a {\'e}t{\'e} d{\'e}velopp{\'e}e, qui s'articule atour de deux aspects principaux. Tout d'abord, la notion de niveaux d'{\'e}mergence est introduite, permettant d'ordonner les comportements observables du syst{\`e}me selon leurs interd{\'e}pendances, afin de choisir comme trait du mod{\`e}le un com- portement correspondant au domaine d'applicabilit{\'e} vis{\'e}. Ordonner les comportements selon leurs niveaux d'{\'e}mergence permet {\'e}galement d'identifier la redondance entre les patrons, qui peut {\^e}tre {\`a} l'origine d'un ph{\'e}nom{\`e}ne de sur-apprentissage lorsqu'ils sont utilis{\'e}s lors de la calibration. Dans un second temps, un nouveau protocole pour la calibration et la validation du ou des traits choisis {\`a} l'aide des niveaux d'{\'e}mergence, nomm{\'e} r{\'e}plication de syst{\`e}me bas{\'e} sur l'individu (Individual Based System Replication - IBSRtion) est {\'e}galement pr{\'e}sent{\'e}. Ce protocole met l'emphase sur la mod{\'e}lisation directe, contrairement au principal protocole existant, la mod{\'e}lisation orient{\'e}e patrons (Pattern Oriented Modelling - POM), et permet une approche empirique en g{\'e}n{\'e}rant artificiellement des donn{\'e}es non disponibles ou ne pouvant {\^e}tre r{\'e}colt{\'e}es par des {\'e}tudes de terrains. IBSRtion a {\'e}galement l'avantage de pouvoir {\^e}tre int{\'e}gr{\'e}e dans POM, afin de contribuer {\`a} la cr{\'e}ation d'une m{\'e}thodologie universelle pour la conception de mod{\`e}les centr{\'e}s sur l'individu. Le processus de conception de ce mod{\`e}le aura entre autre permis de faire une synth{\`e}se des connaissances et d'identifier certaines lacunes. Une {\'e}tude visant {\`a} palier le manque de connaissances satisfaisantes sur les r{\'e}ponses comportementales {\`a} court-terme des proies face au risque de pr{\'e}dation a notamment permis d'observer que celles-ci sont une combinaison de comportements chroniques et {\'e}ph{\'e}m{\`e}res, et que les m{\'e}canismes qui en sont {\`a} l'origine sont complexes et non-lin{\'e}aires.

The distribution of white-tailed deer (               Odocoileus virginianus               ) is expanding across North America, and in some areas, this pattern has led to an increase in predators and consequently higher predation rates on woodland caribou (               Rangifer tarandus caribou               ){\textemdash}an alternate prey species that is declining across western Canada. Understanding the factors influencing deer distribution has therefore become important for effective conservation of caribou in Canada. Changing climate and anthropogenic landscape alteration are hypothesized to facilitate white-tailed deer expansion. Yet, climate and habitat alteration are spatiotemporally correlated, making these factors difficult to isolate. Our study evaluates the relative effects of snow conditions and human-modified habitat (habitat alteration) across space on white-tailed deer presence and relative density. We modeled deer response to snow depth and anthropogenic habitat alteration across a large latitudinal gradient (49{\textdegree} to 60{\textdegree}) in Alberta, Canada, using motion-sensitive camera data collected in winter and spring from 2015 to 2019. Deer distribution in winter and spring were best explained by models including both snow depth and habitat alteration. Sites with shallower snow had higher deer presence regardless of latitude. Increased habitat alteration increased deer presence in the northern portion of the study area only. Winter deer density was best explained by snow depth only, whereas spring density was best explained by both habitat alteration and the previous winter's snow depth. Our results suggest that limiting future habitat alteration or restoring habitat can alter deer distribution, thereby potentially slowing or reversing expansion, but that climate plays a significant role beyond what managers can influence. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Wildlife Society.                        ,              In Alberta, Canada, sites monitored using motion-sensitive cameras between 2015 and 2019 were more likely to have deer present with shallower snow and increased habitat alteration. At sites where deer were present, density was higher in areas with lower snow in winter but with greater habitat alteration in spring. Our results suggest that restoring habitat and limiting future habitat alteration can partially control deer distribution but that climate plays a significant role beyond what managers can influence.},

  abstract = {As the capacity to collect and store large amounts of data expands, identifying and evaluating strategies to efficiently convert raw data into meaningful information is increasingly necessary. Across disciplines, this data processing task has become a significant challenge, delaying progress and actionable insights. In ecology, the growing use of camera traps (i.e., remotely triggered cameras) to collect information on wildlife has led to an enormous volume of raw data (i.e., images) in need of review and annotation. To expedite camera trap image processing, many have turned to the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and use machine learning models to automate tasks such as detecting and classifying wildlife in images. To contribute understanding of the utility of AI tools for processing wildlife camera trap images, we evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art computer vision model developed by Microsoft AI for Earth named MegaDetector using data from an ongoing camera trap study in Arctic Alaska, USA. Compared to image labels determined by manual human review, we found Meg\- aDetector reliably determined the presence or absence of wildlife in images generated by motion detection camera settings ({$\geq$}94.6\% accuracy), however, performance was substantially poorer for images collected with time-lapse camera settings ({$\leq$}61.6\% accuracy). By examining time-lapse images where MegaDetector failed to detect wildlife, we gained practical insights into animal size and distance detection limits and discuss how those may impact the performance of MegaDetector in other systems. We anticipate our findings will stimulate critical thinking about the tradeoffs of using automated AI tools or manual human review to process camera trap images and help to inform effective implementation of study designs.},

  abstract = {It is argued that the problem of pattern and scale is the central problem in ecology, unifying population biology and ecosystems science, and marrying basic and applied ecology. Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an 'observer' of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study of ecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range of scales will have unique causes and biological consequences. The key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging form the collective behaviors of large ensembles of smaller scale units. In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale constraints. Examination of such phenomena requires the study of how pattern and variability change with the scale of description, and the development of laws for simplification, aggregation, and scaling. Examples are given from the marine and terrestrial literatures.},

  abstract = {Predation has long been implicated as a major selective force in the evolution of several morphological and behavioral characteristics of animals. The importance of predation during evolutionary time is clear, but growing evidence suggests that animals also have the ability to assess and behaviorally influence their risk of being preyed upon in ecological time (i.e., during their lifetime). We develop an abstraction of the predation process in which several components of predation risk are identified. A review of the literature indicates that an animal's ability to assess and behaviorally control one or more of these components strongly influences decision making in feeding animals, as well as in animals deciding when and how to escape predators, when and how to be social, or even, for fishes, when and how to breathe air. This review also reveals that such decision making reflects apparent trade-offs between the risk of predation and the benefits to be gained from engaging in a given activity. Despite this body of evidence, several areas in the study of animal behavior have received little or no attention from a predation perspective. We identify several such areas, the most important of which is that dealing with animal reproduction. Much work also remains regarding the precise nature of the risk of predation and how it is actually perceived by animals, and the extent to which they can behaviorally control their risk of predation. Mathematical models will likely play a major role in future work, and we suggest that modelers strive to consider the potential complexity in behavioral responses to predation risk. Overall, since virtually every animal is potential prey for others, research that seriously considers the influence of predation risk will provide significant insight into the nature of animal behavior.},

  abstract = {Food-web modelling is a key tool to provide a global and comprehensive knowledge on community structure, biodiversity and ecosystem processes and functioning. In particular, it allows computing integrative and holistic indices describing food web characteristics, topology and functioning. However, one of the main sources of uncertainty in most food-web models is the estimation of diet matrices. In the present work, we propose an innovative approach that combines (a) a Bayesian mixing model using both isotopes and contaminants as chemical tracers with (b) classical mass-balance equations. This dual approach allows the simultaneous estimation of diet composition, isotopic enrichment, contaminant biomagnification, and contaminants and biomass flows in the whole food web. This original model named ESCROpath also provides food-web indices derived from ecological network analysis (ENA). As a case study, the approach was implemented in the Gironde estuarine food web (SW France) for which isotopes, contaminants and trophic data exist. Two sets of priors were constructed accounting for more or less uncertainty in trophic parameter estimates. Outputs were compared with previous published Ecopath results. A constrained calibration led to very similar outputs as Ecopath (which shows that the method is able to find the initial set of parameters if it is forced to do so), whereas a free calibration led to slight differences in trophic parameters and ENA indice estimations (which shows that the Ecopath solution was not fully optimal). Quite different diet matrices and estimations of flows distribution within the food web can thus be obtained. ESCROpath is an original flexible food-web modelling tool that, for the first time, makes it possible to go from a model mainly built on an `estimate' of the parameters based on expert knowledge (which constitutes the main criticism formulated against Ecopath) to a statistical Bayesian framework for the estimation of the trophic parameters. It thus provides a very integrated framework for food-web modelling by estimating simultaneously trophic parameters, diet compositions and trophic enrichment/magnification factors. By doing this, it notably provides reliable and robust uncertainty estimations for output parameters.},

Using a large dataset of mountain ecosystems encompassing more than 2,000 species across the globe, we analyze the prevalence and importance of both positive and negative associations among plants. Our findings indicate that facilitation and competition between plant species must be studied together in order to explain biodiversity change.           ,              Biological diversity depends on multiple, cooccurring ecological interactions. However, most studies focus on one interaction type at a time, leaving community ecologists unsure of how positive and negative associations among species combine to influence biodiversity patterns. Using surveys of plant populations in alpine communities worldwide, we explore patterns of positive and negative associations among triads of species (modules) and their relationship to local biodiversity. Three modules, each incorporating both positive and negative associations, were overrepresented, thus acting as "network motifs." Furthermore, the overrepresentation of these network motifs is positively linked to species diversity globally. A theoretical model illustrates that these network motifs, based on competition between facilitated species or facilitation between inferior competitors, increase local persistence. Our findings suggest that the interplay of competition and facilitation is crucial for maintaining biodiversity.},

In contrast to the specialist predator-prey model, the dynamics of this system is more complex. It turns out that there exist some critical advection rates and predation rates, which classify the global dynamics of the generalist predator-prey system into three or four scenarios: (1) coexistence; (2) persistence of prey only; (3) persistence of predators only; and (4) extinction of both species. Moreover, the results reveal significant differences between the specialist predator-prey system and the generalist predator-prey system, including the evolution of the critical predation rates with respect to the ratio of the flow speeds; the take-over of the generalist predator; and the reduction in parameter range for the persistence of prey species alone. These findings may have important biological implications on the invasion of generalist predators in open advective environments.},

By the signs of the associated principal eigenvalues, we derive the existence and local stability of the trivial and semi-trivial steady-state solutions. Moreover, the nonexistence and existence of the coexistence steady-state solutions stemming from the two boundary steady states are obtained as well. In particular, we describe the feature of the coincidence of bifurcating coexistence steady-state solution branches. At the same time, the effect of advection on the stability of the bifurcating solution is also investigated, and our results suggest that the advection term may change the stability. Finally, we point out that the methods we applied here are mainly based on spectral analysis, perturbation theory, comparison principle, monotone theory, Lyapunov{\textendash}Schmidt reduction, and bifurcation theory.},

In the Fennoscandian boreal region, forestry with clearcutting is a threat to biodiversity causing the loss of mature forest elements and deterioration of ecological processes in forest landscapes, ultimately affecting PAs via declined structural connectivity. This paper aims to (1) determine PAs with high, red-listed species concentrations; (2) estimate the change in forest habitat around these PAs on different spatial scales; and (3) determine if forest management intensity is higher around biologically most valuable PAs. Occurrences of red-listed forest-dwelling species in Finland were used to identify PAs harbouring these species and to produce site-specific importance indices. CORINE landcover data was used as a baseline for the distribution of forests to assess the cover of clear-cuttings from 2001 to 2019 with the Global Forest Change (GFC) data set in three buffer areas around the PAs with occurrences of red-listed species.},

Lichens are important forage for caribou (               Rangifer tarandus               ), whose populations are declining throughout most of North America. To clarify how lichen cover might affect caribou resource selection, ecologists require better data on the spatial distribution and abundance of lichen. Here, we use a combination of field data and satellite imagery to model lichen cover for a 583 200 km               2               area that fully encompasses nine caribou ranges in interior Alaska and Yukon. We aggregated data from               in situ               vegetation plots, aerial survey polygons and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery to align with 30 m resolution Landsat pixels. We used these data to train a random forest model with a suite of environmental and spectral predictors to estimate lichen cover. We validated our lichen cover model using reserved training data and existing external datasets, and found that reserved data from aerial survey polygons (               R               2               ~=~0.77) and UAV imagery (               R               2               ~=~0.71) provided the best fit. We used our lichen cover map to evaluate the influence of estimated lichen cover on caribou resource selection in the Fortymile Herd from 2012 to 2018 during summer and winter. In both seasons, caribou avoided lichen-poor areas (0\%{\textendash}5\% lichen cover) and showed stronger selection as lichen cover increased to {$\sim$}30\%, above which selection leveled off. Our results suggest that terrestrial lichen cover is an important factor influencing caribou resource selection in northern boreal forests across seasons. Our lichen cover map goes beyond existing maps of lichen abundance and distribution because it incorporates extensive field data for model training and validation and estimates lichen cover over a much larger spatial extent. We expect our landscape-scale map will be useful for understanding trends in lichen abundance and distribution, as well as for caribou research, management and conservation.},

For example, a more productive environment should lead to more restricted diet in numbers of different species eaten. In a patchy environment, however, this will not apply to predators that spend most of their time searching. Moreover, larger patches are used in a more specialized way than smaller patches.}

To test this hypothesis, we investigated activity patterns of two caribou populations at the same latitude: one captive with no food limitation and the other wild and free-ranging in the Alaska Range in interior Alaska known to be at the end of a 3-year low plane of nutrition. For captive caribou, activity patterns were determined from focal-animal behavioural observations each month except May. Data were collected on wild caribou using activity-recording radio collars in each of three seasons: late winter, postcalving, and midsummer. Wild and captive caribou exhibited nychthemeral activity and did not time activity to sunrise or sunset. Wild caribou exhibited no among-group synchrony. Within-group synchrony was high in both herds. Wild caribou exhibited significantly fewer cycles of activity than captive caribou. Longer resting bouts in late winter, and longer active bouts postcalving and in midsummer for wild caribou, were interpreted as behavioural responses to ecological effects of limited food availability, with and without snow, and disturbance by insects.},

  abstract = {Sensitivity analyses that assess the impact of changing vital rates on population growth have been widely used to guide conservation. If implemented with caution, they can provide guidance as to which management actions will optimize conservation outcomes. In this review, we first focus on the commonly used proportional sensitivity and elasticity analyses that change each vital rate by equal proportions, to assess their importance for wildlife management. These types of analyses also feature potential pitfalls and limitations, including (1) Each vital rate is usually on a different scale. Without appropriate scaling this can result in a flawed evaluation of the importance of vital rates. (2) Vital rates rarely change at equal proportions in nature. This can bring about misguided management recommendations on the basis of vital rate changes that are unrealistic. (3) Proportional sensitivity analyses often do not reflect the feasibility and effectiveness of altering particular demographic parameters. Consequently, relying solely on proportional sensitivities or elasticities can lead to flawed evaluation of the importance of vital rates and thus prioritization of management options that are unrealistic or ineffective. We outline alternative approaches, which involve assessing the impact of threats, the relative demography of stable and declining populations, the effect of observable variation of vital rates on population viability, and the potential effects of feasible management scenarios. Synthesis and applications. Sensitivity analyses are useful tools to guide wildlife management. If implemented and interpreted with care, sensitivity analyses can identify key demographic parameters and threats to population viability. However, their usefulness is limited, when applied without careful evaluation as to whether the perturbations evaluated are realistic, feasible and meet the need of wildlife managers. We caution against the over-reliance on proportional sensitivity and elasticity analyses and point to alternative approaches, including life-stage simulation analysis, vital rate sensitivity analysis or manual perturbations.},

  abstract = {Many analytical techniques that assess resource selection focus on individual relocation points as the sample unit and classify resources as either used or available. Commonly, the relative use of each resource is quantified as the number of observations in each resource class or the proportional occurrence of a resource within a home range. We believe that a more accurate estimate can be summarized by a utilization distribution (UD). We present an analytical approach that explicitly incorporates a probabilistic measure of use, as defined by the UD. We used animal relocation points and fixed-kernel techniques to determine a UD within a home range. We related this probabilistic measure of use to categorical and continuous resource variables using multiple regression. Regression errors accounted for spatial autocorrelation so that the significance of regression coefficients could be appraised for each animal and averaged across animals. This allowed us to quantify the individualistic nature of resource selection and test for consistency in use of resources by a population. Sample sizes in population assessments correctly reflected the individual animal as the experimental unit. We used this technique in a geographic information system setting to examine the importance of local-scale (forest cover) and landscape-scale (degree of fragmentation, proximity to edges and human use areas) attributes to breeding season habitat selection by 25 radio-tagged Steller's Jays (Cyanocitta stelleri) in western Washington State, USA. Individual jays varied significantly in habitat use, but most (20) concentrated their use in areas with many vegetation patches or in areas with extensive edge between forest and nonforested land cover. This confirmed our prediction that jays prefer fragmented habitat and forest edges and helped to explain why jays are most abundant in fragmented landscapes. However, we refined our understanding of why they used such habitats by demonstrating that landscape attributes affected use of local habitat features: high-contrast edges were used most if they were associated with small human settlements and campgrounds. Use of patchy and edgy areas within home ranges may be reinforced by natural selection because jays that inhabited areas with complex-shaped patches and concentrated their activity in such areas were most likely to fledge young. Concentration of use along forest{\textendash}human land use interfaces may explain the greater risk of nest predation to other birds in such settings.},

Whether species respond to such changes individualistically or collectively (e.g. as functional groups) is still unclear. To address this question, we used an extensive new dataset for the lake communities in the Azores' archipelago to test whether: 1) individual species respond concordantly within trophic groups; 2) trophic groups respond concordantly to biogeographic and environmental gradients. Spatial concordance in individual species distributions within trophic groups was always greater than expected by chance. In contrast, trophic groups varied non-concordantly along biogeographic and environmental gradients revealing idiosyncratic responses to them. Whether communities respond individualistically to environmental gradients thus depends on the functional resolution of the data. Our study challenges the view that modelling environmental change effects on biodiversity always requires an individualist approach. Instead, it finds support for the longstanding idea that communities might be modelled as a cohort if the functional resolution is appropriate.},

Here, using nonlinear models, we study the influence of interaction strength (likelihood of consumption of one species by another) on food-web dynamics away from equilibrium. Consistent with previous suggestions,, our results show that weak to intermediate strength links are important in promoting community persistence and stability. Weak links act to dampen oscillations between consumers and resources. This tends to maintain population densities further away from zero, decreasing the statistical chance that a population will become extinct (lower population densities are more prone to such chances). Data on interaction strengths in natural food webs indicate that food-web interaction strengths are indeed characterized by many weak interactions and a few strong interactions.},

This approach is used to evaluate the importance of fecundity parameters and the initial number of non-breeding birds in a stochastic stage-structured model of helmeted honeyeater Lichenostomus melanops cassidix population dynamics. The regression analysis indicates which model parameters have the greatest impact on the risk of population decline. The results demonstrate that a simple expression containing the parameters of the model can encapsulate predictions of risk. This technique is proposed as an efficient alternative method of sensitivity analysis for population viability models. Of four fecundity parameters, the mean fecundity of intact pairs had the greatest influence on the risks faced by the helmeted honeyeater population. Mean fecundity of split pairs and the sex ratio of offspring were also important parameters. Over the range of parameters considered in this paper, environmental variation in fecundity and the initial number of non-breeding birds had little influence on the risks of decline. The importance of interactions between parameters was analysed.},

Here, we present a novel approach that uses readily available ecological data to build spatially-structured species interaction networks and predict metacommunity responses to environmental change. Predictive Multilayer Networks (PMNs) model the distributions, interspecific interactions, and spatial connectivity of multiple species across a landscape and quantify network structure and stability. We provide a proof-of-concept using a simulated plant-pollinator community, measure network centrality to identify areas of high functional connectivity, and compare land cover scenarios to predict effects of forest loss and restoration on PMN connectance and robustness. PMNs synthesize network approaches from community and landscape ecology and offer a flexible, predictive approach for examining the spatial dynamics of species interactions.},

They are particularly abundant in arctic-alpine and boreal regions, where they are a primary food source for woodland caribou/reindeer in winter months. Determining the growth rates of reindeer lichen is important for understanding and managing lichen regeneration following disturbances such as timber harvesting, mining, grazing, and wildfire. Regeneration and rehabilitation rates can be calculated with greater accuracy when growth rates are well understood. We provide a summary of 17 studies from 6 countries that determined the linear growth rates of three reindeer lichen groups, Cladonia arbuscula/mitis (mean = 4.7 mm/yr.), C. rangiferina/ C. stygia (mean = 5.1 mm/yr.), and C. stellaris (mean = 4.8 mm/yr.). We use linear growth rates as a proxy for over-all growth and biomass. Variables found to influence lichen growth rates are also discussed, which include light, moisture, temperature, air pollution, acid rain, precipitation, snow accumulation, substrate, age of individuals, and type of disturbance. These results can assist land managers in developing more accurate strategies for restoring lichens in disturbed areas.},

  abstract = {Wolves are some of the world's most charismatic and controversial animals, capturing the imaginations of their friends and foes alike. Highly intelligent and adaptable, they hunt and play together in close-knit packs, sometimes roaming over hundreds of square miles in search of food. Once teetering on the brink of extinction across much of the United States and Europe, wolves have made a tremendous comeback in recent years, thanks to legal protection, changing human attitudes, and efforts to reintroduce them to suitable habitats in North America.As wolf populations have rebounded, scientific studies of them have also flourished. But there hasn't been a systematic, comprehensive overview of wolf biology since 1970. In Wolves, many of the world's leading wolf experts provide state-of-the-art coverage of just about everything you could want to know about these fascinating creatures. Individual chapters cover wolf social ecology, behavior, communication, feeding habits and hunting techniques, population dynamics, physiology and pathology, molecular genetics, evolution and taxonomy, interactions with nonhuman animals such as bears and coyotes, reintroduction, interactions with humans, and conservation and recovery efforts. The book discusses both gray and red wolves in detail and includes information about wolves around the world, from the United States and Canada to Italy, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Israel, India, and Mongolia. Wolves is also extensively illustrated with black and white photos, line drawings, maps, and fifty color plates.Unrivalled in scope and comprehensiveness, Wolves will become the definitive resource on these extraordinary animals for scientists and amateurs alike. ``An excellent compilation of current knowledge, with contributions from all the main players in wolf research. . . .

To provide appropriate perspective for determining unusual or extreme fluctuations in their managed wolf populations, we analyzed natural, longterm, wolf-population-density trajectories totaling 130 years of data from 3 areas: Isle Royale National Park in Lake Superior, Michigan, USA; the east-central Superior National Forest in northeastern Minnesota, USA; and Denali National Park, Alaska, USA. Ratios between minimum and maximum annual sizes for 2 mainland populations (n = 28 and 46 yr) varied from 2.5{\textendash}2.8, whereas for Isle Royale (n = 56 yr), the ratio was 6.3. The interquartile range (25th percentile, 75th percentile) for annual growth rates, Nt{\th}1/Nt, was (0.88, 1.14), (0.92, 1.11), and (0.86, 1.12) for Denali, Superior National Forest, and Isle Royale respectively. We fit a density-independent model and a Ricker model to each time series, and in both cases we considered the potential for observation error. Mean growth rates from the density-independent model were close to 0 for all 3 populations, with 95\% credible intervals including 0. We view the estimated model parameters, including those describing annual variability or process variance, as providing useful summaries of the trajectories of these populations. The estimates of these natural wolf population parameters can serve as benchmarks for comparison with those of recovering wolf populations. Because our study populations were all from circumscribed areas, fluctuations in them represent fluctuations in densities (i.e., changes in numbers are not confounded by changes in occupied area as would be the case with populations expanding their range, as are wolf populations in many states). {\'O} 2015 The Wildlife Society.},

Such predictions are useful not only to forecast direct effects of climate, productivity, land use, or habitat degradation, but also changes in the food web, such as expanding/{\dbend}increasing species that are predators, prey, and competitors of populations of concern. Explicit consideration of food webs and their dynamics in more complex models could provide better predictions of future changes, and allow us to better assess the influence of management actions. Here, we present our perspective on what we have learned from conducting a number of case studies using such a food web approach with a focus on climate and harvest impacts and their implications for management. We found empirical support for many of our hypothesized food web effects, and were able in some cases to obtain short-term forecasts with slightly lower prediction error using models that account for food web dynamics compared with simpler models. Predictions are the foundation of adaptive management because they allow quantitative assessment of the effects of management actions; however, evaluating predictions requires adequate and high-quality monitoring data. Results from our case studies show that a combination of long-term monitoring and different types of study designs coupled with models of adequate complexity are likely required to better understand populations' responses to environmental changes and harvest, as well as the consequences for food webs.},

In such a one-predator{\textendash}two-prey system, indirect interactions can occur between the two pest species, such as apparent competition and apparent mutualism. Whereas apparent competition is desired because it brings pest levels down, apparent mutualism is not, because it does the opposite. Because apparent competition and apparent mutualism occurs at different time scales, it is important to investigate the effects of a shared natural enemy on biological control on a time scale relevant for crop growth. We evaluated the control efficacy of the predatory mites Amblyseius swirskii (Athias-Henriot) and Euseius ovalis (Evans) in cucumber crops in greenhouse compartments with only thrips, only whiteflies or both herbivorous insects together. Each of the two predators controlled thrips, but A. swirskii reduced thrips densities the most. There was no effect of the presence of whiteflies on thrips densities. Whitefly control by each of the two predators in absence of thrips was not sufficient, yet better with E. ovalis. However, whitefly densities in presence of thrips were reduced dramatically, especially by A. swirskii. The densities of predators were up to 15 times higher in presence of both pests than in the single-pest treatments. Laboratory experiments with A. swirskii suggest that this is due to a higher juvenile survival and developmental rate on a mixed diet. Hence, better control may be achieved not only because of apparent competition, but also through a positive effect of mixed diets on predator population growth. This latter phenomenon deserves more attention in experimental and theoretical work on biological control and apparent competition.},

In an attempt to test whether or not moose were regulated by predators, we investigated wolf predation near this equilibrium density (0.37) and at 2 lower densities ( {\textasciitilde} 0.23, 0.17). Scat analysis in summer and feeding observations in winter indicated a greater use of alternative food resources by wolves at lower moose densities. Each wolf pack killed on average 5.3, 1.8, 1.1 moose-100 days in the area of 0.37, 0.23, and 0.17 moose-kin 2, respectively. Consumption of moose per wolf was 2.8, 1.7, and 1.6 kg/day, respectively. January wolf densities were estimated at 1.38, 0.82, and 0.36 animals. 100 km 2, respectively. Year-long predation rates proved to be density-dependent, increasing with moose density from 6.1 to 19.3\% of the postnatal populations. We conclude that moose populations in southwestern Quebec are regulated largely by predators (wolves and maybe black bears) at a density where competition for forage produces no detrimental effect. We support the concept that wolf predation can have an important regulatory effect at low moose densities but also a depensatory (inversely density-dependent) effect at higher densities.},

Wolf densities in January averaged 0.8 and 1.4 animals{$\bullet$}100\hspace{0.6em}km               -2               , packs consisted of 3.7 and 5.7 individuals, year-long territory sizes were 255 and 390\hspace{0.6em}km               2               , and interstices between territories represented 30 and [Formula: see text] of available area, for the LP and HP areas, respectively. Territory size increased significantly with pack size. The LP wolf population suffered from a higher mortality rate owing to a higher occurrence of deaths from malnutrition and intraspecific strife, and from a lower success in producing pups (61\% of the possible occasions, compared with 93\% in HP). When no other ungulate species is present, a density of 0.2 moose{$\bullet$}km               -2               would approximate the density threshold below which a pack could not subsist and (or) reproduce successfully.

  abstract = {In this article I examine moose-wolf interactions over a broad spectrum of moose densities with the primary objective to test empirically whether wolf predation can regulate moose numbers. I also present four conceptual models of moose population dynamics and outline their specific predictions. Based on 27 studies where moose were the dominant prey species, the functional and numerical responses of wolves to changing moose density were derived using an hyperbolic, Michaelis-Menten function. Per capita killing rate was strongly related (P = .01) to moose density, as was the density of wolves (P {$<$} .01). Killing rate plateaued at 3.36 moose@?wolf\^-\^1@?(100 days)\^-\^1 when predators were fully satiated. The asymptotic value for wolf density was 58.7 animals/1000 km\^2. Wolf predation rate, as derived from the total predator response, proved to be density dependent from 0 to 0.65 moose/km\^2, and inversely density dependent at higher moose densities. Predator: prey ratios reflected wolf predation rate poorly because they did not integrate the functional response. An empirical model based on these results suggests that moose would stabilize at 2.0 moose/km\^2 in the absence of predators, and at @?1.3 moose/km\^2 in the presence of a single predator, the wolf. Density-dependent food competition creates these two high-density equilibrium conditions. If moose productivity is diminished through either deteriorating habitat quality or bear-induced early calf mortality, then a low-density equilibrium (0.2-0.4 moose/km\^2) is predicted. The model also suggests that when a low equilibrium develops, a "predator pit" is absent or extremely shallow, thus arguing against the appropriateness of a predation-food two-state model. Further research on the density relationship of bear predation, on the effect of alternate prey on wolf total response, and on the regulatory impact of food competition at high moose densities, is required for a full understanding of moose demography.},

We reviewed the literature searching for systematic relationships between structural food-web properties and environmental gradients. Temperature and biotic factors are amongst the most frequently addressed drivers of food-web structure. We also assessed the degree to which food-web ecology has accomplished a mechanistic understanding of ecosystem functioning. We found that most studies are one-off descriptions of local food webs making it difficult to achieve an understanding of the response to human or environmental gradients. The lack of a consistent theory predicting how food webs change across environmental gradients, the diversity of objectives in food-web studies, and the absence of a standardized methodology for analysing them severely limit progress in the field. Moving forward requires the establishment of a core set of testable predictions, agreed standards for data collection and analysis, and the development of geographically distributed experimental studies of food-web dynamics.},

  abstract = {Global biodiversity is threatened by the anthropogenic restructuring of animal communities, rewiring species interaction networks in real-time as individuals are extirpated or introduced. Conservation science and adaptive ecosystem management demand more rapid, quantitative, and non-invasive technologies for robustly capturing changing biodiversity and quantifying species interactions. Here we develop molecular ecological network analyses (MENA) as an ecosystem assessment tool to address these needs. To construct the ecological network, we used environmental DNA from feces to identify the plant and mammal diet of two carnivores: puma (Puma concolor) and bobcat (Lynx rufus); two omnivores: coyote (Canis latrans) and gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus); and two herbivores: black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus) in a well-studied Californian reserve. To evaluate MENA as a comprehensive biodiversity tool, we applied our framework to identify the structure of the network, patterns of trophic interactions, key species, and to assess its utility in capturing the biodiversity of the area. The high dietary taxonomic resolution enabled the assessment of species diversity, niche breadth and overlap. The network analysis revealed a dense ecological network with a high diversity of weakly connected species and a community that is highly modular and non-nested. The significant prevalence of tri-trophic chain and exploitative competition patterns indicates (i) the removal or reintroduction of a top predator would trigger a trophic cascade within this community, directly affecting their prey and indirectly the plant communities, and (ii) the potential impact of indirect effects between two predators that consume the same prey. These results suggest that the recent resurgence of puma in the study area may impact the herbaceous and woody vegetation and the population size of other predators. This effect of fluctuating predator populations and plant communities could be predicted through MENA's fine-scale assessment of the diet selection and the identified keystone species. Although just using a subset of species, MENA more rapidly, accurately, and effectively captured the broader biodiversity of the area in comparison to other methodologies. MENA reconstructed and unveiled the hidden complexity in trophic structure and interaction networks within the community, providing a promising toolkit for biodiversity and ecosystem management.},

  abstract = {The utilization distribution of an animal describes the relative probability of space use. It is natural to think of it as the long-term consequence of the animal's short-term movement decisions: it is the accumulation of small displacements which, over time, gives rise to global patterns of space use. However, many estimation methods for the utilization distribution either assume the independence of observed locations and ignore the underlying movement (e.g. kernel density estimation), or are based on simple Brownian motion movement rules (e.g. Brownian bridges). We introduce a new continuous-time model of animal movement, based on the Langevin diffusion. This stochastic process has an explicit stationary distribution, conceptually analogous to the idea of the utilization distribution, and thus provides an intuitive framework to integrate movement and space use. We model the stationary (utilization) distribution with a resource selection function to link the movement to spatial covariates, and allow inference about habitat preferences of animals. Standard approximation techniques can be used to derive the pseudo-likelihood of the Langevin diffusion movement model, and to estimate habitat preference and movement parameters from tracking data. We investigate the performance of the method on simulated data, and discuss its sensitivity to the time scale of the sampling. We present an example of its application to tracking data of Steller sea lions Eumetopias jubatus. Due to its continuous-time formulation, this method can be applied to irregular telemetry data. The movement model is specified using a habitat-dependent utilization distribution, and it provides a rigorous framework to estimate long-term habitat selection from correlated movement data. The Langevin movement model can be written as a linear model, which allows for very fast inference. Standard tools such as residuals can be used for model checking.},

Despite this long recognition of the coexistence of multiple interaction types in nature, little is known about the consequences of this diversity for community functioning. In the ongoing context of global change and increasing species extinction rates, it seems crucial to improve our understanding of the drivers of the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem functioning. Here, using a multispecies dynamical model of ecological communities including various interaction types (e.g. competition for space, predator interference, recruitment facilitation in addition to feeding), we studied the role of the presence and the intensity of these interactions for species diversity, community functioning (biomass and production) and the relationship between diversity and functioning.Taken jointly, the diverse interactions have significant effects on species diversity, whose amplitude and sign depend on the type of interactions involved and their relative abundance. They however consistently increase the slope of the relationship between diversity and functioning, suggesting that species losses might have stronger effects on community functioning than expected when ignoring the diversity of interaction types and focusing on feeding interactions only.},

  abstract = {In recent decades the `landscape of fear' has grown in popularity to become a central consideration in wildlife management, and has even been reconceptualized as the `landscape of coexistence' for understanding human-wildlife conflicts such as predator attacks on livestock. Yet fear effects are not always the predominant driver of predator-prey interactions. Thus, guiding ecological principles have not been assembled to explain the broader food web interactions that shape the context dependency of carnivore-livestock conflict. We address this gap by developing a conceptual framework as a way to think about the contingencies under which inducing non-consumptive `fear effects' on predators would be effective to mitigate carnivore-livestock conflict. The framework specifically considers interactions among wildlife (carnivore predators, wild ungulate prey) and humans (people and livestock) in terms of spatial predator-prey assemblages in which the nature of wildlife-human interactions {\textendash} as either a carnivore-livestock conflict or a coexistence food web {\textendash} is contingent on the nature of spatial movement and overlap of humans and wildlife across landscapes. Considering human-wildlife interactions within such a spatial food web context can assist in enabling people and wildlife, especially imperiled carnivores, to coexist in human-modified landscapes. The framework offers predictions that should be tested via adaptive management experiments that evaluate whether conflict mitigation solutions aligned with particular spatial human-livestock-carnivore contexts do indeed resolve conflict.},

  abstract = {For socially monogamous species, breeder bond dissolution has important consequences for population dynamics, but the extent to which extrinsic or intrinsic population factors causes pair dissolution remain poorly understood, especially among carnivores. Using an extensive life-history data set, a survival analysis and competing risks framework, we examined the fate of 153 different wolf (Canis lupus) pairs in the recolonizing Scandinavian wolf population, during 14 winters of snow tracking and DNA monitoring. Wolf pair dissolution was generally linked to a mortality event and was strongly affected by extrinsic (i.e. anthropogenic) causes. No divorce was observed, and among the pair dissolution where causes have been identified, death of one or both wolves was always involved. Median time from pair formation to pair dissolution was three consecutive winters (i.e. approximately 2 years). Pair dissolution was mostly human-related, primarily caused by legal control actions (36{$\cdot$}7\%), verified poaching (9{$\cdot$}2\%) and traffic-related causes (2{$\cdot$}1\%). Intrinsic factors, such as disease and age, accounted for only 7{$\cdot$}7\% of pair dissolutions. The remaining 44{$\cdot$}3\% of dissolution events were from unknown causes, but we argue that a large portion could be explained by an additional source of human-caused mortality, cryptic poaching. Extrinsic population factors, such as variables describing the geographical location of the pair, had a stronger effect on risk of pair dissolution compared to anthropogenic landscape characteristics. Population intrinsic factors, such as the inbreeding coefficient of the male pair member, had a negative effect on pair bond duration. The mechanism behind this result remains unknown, but might be explained by lower survival of inbred males or more complex inbreeding effects mediated by behaviour. Our study provides quantitative estimates of breeder bond duration in a social carnivore and highlights the effect of extrinsic (i.e. anthropogenic) and intrinsic factors (i.e. inbreeding) involved in wolf pair bond duration. Unlike the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that are commonly reported on individual survival or population growth, here we provide quantitative estimates of their potential effect on the social unit of the population, the wolf pair.},

Fear of predation restricts the development of prey and promotes inducible defense in prey communities for the survival. Motivated by this fact, we investigate the dynamics of a Leslie{\textendash}Gower predator prey model with group defense in a fearful prey. We obtain conditions under which system possess unique global-in-time solutions and determine all the biological feasible states of the system. Local stability is analyzed by linearization technique and Lyapunov direct method has been applied for global stability analysis of steady states. We show the occurrence of Hopf bifurcation and its direction at the vicinity of coexisting equilibrium point for temporal model. We consider random movement in species and establish conditions for the stability of the system in the presence of diffusion. We derive conditions for existence of non-constant steady states and Turing instability at coexisting population state of diffusive system. Incorporating indirect prey taxis with the assumption that the predator moves toward the smell of prey rather than random movement gives rise to taxis-driven inhomogeneous Hopf bifurcation in predator{\textendash}prey model. Numerical simulations are intended to demonstrate the role of biological as well as physical drivers on pattern formation that go beyond analytical conclusions.},

In this work, we analyze the dynamics of a predator{\textendash}prey interaction with the impact of predator's (a generalist predator with constant biomass) fear and its carry-over effects. First, we investigate the effect of predator's fear on a single-species system neglecting the predation term. Next, we study the dynamics of Holling type II predator{\textendash}prey system with the influence of prey refuge. Basic dynamical properties, as well as global stability of each equilibria, have been studied. It is observed that both the fear and its carry-over effects have great impact on the stability of the interior equilibrium point. Moreover, the phenomenon ``paradox of enrichment'' is shown in our proposed system and classical Holling type II model but it can be ruled out in the absence of carry-over effect. Further, we notice that prey refuge has great impact on the persistence of the predator population. Lastly, our proposed system has been compared with a stochastic model using Gaussian white noise terms due to the effect of fluctuating environment.},

The linkage between density-dependent habitat use, population regulation and community organization is examined on the basis of qualitative and quantitative differences between habitats. These differences are expressed as characteristic shapes on isodars which are lines of equal fitness, and are plotted in density space as lines at every point of which the fitness of individuals in one habitat is equal to that of individuals in another. Isodars can be constructed for single species or modified to include the effects of interacting species. Isodars are easily analyzed by linear regression to differentiate between alternative modes of population regulation and to suggest patterns of community structure. Different isodars are causally related to different kinds of community structure, and suggest the existence of four new forms of community organization; equal, differential, switched and mixed preferences. A preliminary isodar analysis on a common rodent species demonstrates that population regulation depends upon habitat, and that mixed preferences probably organize the rodent community. Habitat-dependent population regulation has farreaching implications to studies of temporal and spatial scale, and to all ecological processes that are density-dependent.},

  abstract = {Habitat selection, and its associated density and frequency-dependent evolution, has a profound influence on such vital phenomena as population regulation, species interactions, the assembly of ecological communities, and the origin and maintenance of biodiversity. Different strategies of habitat selection, and their importance in ecology and evolution, can often be revealed simply by plots of density in adjacent habitats. For individual species, the strategies are closely intertwined with mechanisms of population regulation, and with the persistence of populations through time. For interacting species, strategies of habitat selection are not only responsible for species coexistence, but provide one of the most convenient mechanisms for measuring competition, and the various community structures caused by competitive interactions. Other kinds of interactions, such as those between predators and prey, demonstrate that an understanding of the coevolution of habitat-selection strategies among strongly interacting species is essential to properly interpret their spatial and temporal dynamics. At the evolutionary scale, the frequency dependence associated with habitat selection may often allow populations to diverge and diversify into separate species. Habitat selection thereby demonstrates how we can map microevolutionary strategies in behavior onto their population and community consequences, and from there, onto macroevolutionary patterns of speciation and adaptive radiation. We can anticipate that future studies of habitat selection will not only help us complete those maps, but that they will also continue to enrich the panoply of ideas that shape evolutionary ecology.},

This contradiction has steered ecologists toward exploring what underlying processes allow complex communities to stabilize even through varying pressures. In this study, a food web model is used to show an overlooked role of interference among multiple predator species in solving this complexity-stability problem. Predator interference in large communities weakens species interactions due to a reduction in consumption rates by prey-sharing species in the presence of predators in response to territorial and aggressive behavior, thereby playing a key stabilizing role in communities. Especially when interspecific interference is strong and a community has diverse species and dense species interactions, stabilization is likely to work and creates a positive complexity-stability relationship within a community. The clear positive effect of complexity on community stability is not reflected by/intraspecific interference, emphasizing the key role of interspecific interference among multiple predator species in maintaining larger systems.},

An obvious question arises in ecosystem is that how predator affect the density of prey population. In most of the ecological models, predators reduce prey densities by direct killing which is a minor part in population dynamics. Experimental studies on vertebrate has shown that fear of predators can influence the behavioural pattern of prey population and reduce their reproduction. Mathematical models of predator{\textendash}prey system with variety of predator functional responses with fear effect are studied recently. These studies ignore the fear effect on the death rate of prey species. Based on the above observation, we propose a mathematical model of predator{\textendash}prey system with the cost of fear that affect reproduction and death rate of prey population. We also include a term modelling intraspecific competition within the predator population. This additional term limits the predator population growth for large predator to prey density ratios. Basic results on the positivity and boundedness of the solutions, feasibility of equilibria, local and global stability and uniform persistence (ensuring the long term survival of the species) and limit cycles and its nature are investigated. Numerical experiments are performed to test the theoretical results obtained for this model.},

In switching, the number of attacks upon a species is disproportionately large when the species is abundant relative to other prey, and disproportionately small when the species is relatively rare. The null case for two prey species can be written: P"1/P"2 = cN"1/N"2, where P"1/P"2 is the ratio of the two prey expected in the diet, N"1/N"2 is the ratio given and c is a proportionality constant. Predators were sea-shore snails and prey were mussels and barnacles. Experiments in the laboratory modelled aspects of various natural situations. When the predator had a strong preference (c) between prey the data and the @'null case@' model were in good agreement. Preference could not altered by subjecting predators to training regimens. When preference was weak the data did not fit the model replicates were variable. Predators could be trained easily to one or other prey species. From a number of experiments it was concluded that in the weak-preference case no switch would occur in nature except where there is an opportunity for predators to become trained to the abundant species. A patchy distribution of the abundant prey could provide this opportunity. Given one prey species, snails caused a decreasing percentage mortality as prey numbers increased. This occurred also with 2 prey species present when preference was strong. When preference was weak the form of the response was unclear. When switching occurred the percentage prey mortality increased with prey density, giving potentially stabilizing mortality. The consequences of these conclusions for prey population regulation and for diversity are discussed.},

We ask whether such models are relevant to the real world. Two-species population models of an interacting consumer and resource collapse to one-species dynamics when recruitment to the resource population is unrelated to resource abundance, thereby weakening the coupling between consumer and resource. We predict that, in nature, generalist consumers that feed on many species should similarly show one-species dynamics. We test this prediction using cyclic populations, in which it is easier to infer underlying mechanisms, and which are widespread in nature. Here we show that one-species cycles can be distinguished from consumer resource cycles by their periods. We then analyse a large number of time series from cyclic populations in nature and show that almost all cycling, generalist consumers examined have periods that are consistent with one-species dynamics. Thus generalist consumers indeed behave as if they were one-species populations, and a one-species model is a valid representation for generalist population dynamics in many-species food webs.},

  abstract = {The following study tested the viability of managing wolf populations via the presence of managed "wolf restaurants". Wolf restaurants in this context refers to supplementary feeding of wolves in close proximity to their den or areas where wolves frequent within their territory. An individual based model was built using the Netlogo software. The model was used to computationally test this theory as it has not yet been attempted in the field. This form of management was tested in two simulated wilderness areas; a large area (3000km 2 ) and a smaller area (312km 2 ). This study found that in a large wilderness area with a stable wolf population and medium densities of wild prey, nutrition management was effective in reducing dispersion by 33\% and livestock depredation by 55\%. The model was then tested for a smaller wilderness area. It was discovered that when prey density was high and wolf restaurants were present, livestock depredation was reduced by 450\% and movement ecology was reduced by as much as 300\% compared to unmanaged wolves in the same environment. The results of this model suggest that wolf nutrition management is possible to mitigate instances of wolf-human conflicts in large wild communities, but that smaller ecological islands of wilderness with high prey density is where it has the potential to work best. The smaller simulated wilderness area emulates that which wolves are moving into throughout Europe. Wolf nutrition management can be used as a tool to enhance the success of future wolf reintroductions and re-establishments.},

Structured decision-making approaches can help evaluate such complex problems by formalizing objectives and constraints into functions that quantify the benefits and costs associated with each action. Yet, many of the scientific tools necessary to implement structured decision making require extensive literature review and often involve complex algorithms that make them inaccessible to managers. To address these issues, we integrated available information and developed a decision-support tool that managers can readily use to compare costs and benefits associated with alternative recovery actions for threatened species. Our software can be used to quantitatively estimate and compare the costs and demographic benefits of recovery actions for an iconic threatened species, woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). While we use caribou as a case study, our approach to developing this management tool is transferable to other threatened taxa. The tool consists of a generalized matrix population model that is parametrized based on information from the published literature or ongoing experiments. Users can input population parameters (e.g., population size and survival rates) or choose from pre-set caribou subpopulations to estimate changes to populations from implementing recovery actions. The tool estimates the trade-offs associated with seven alternative recovery actions: linear feature restoration (LFR), linear feature deactivation (LFD), maternal penning (MP), conservation breeding (CB), predator exclosure (PE), wolf reduction (WR), and moose reduction (MR). We demonstrate our software by comparing recovery actions for the East Side Athabasca River caribou subpopulation and discuss how this tool can be used under a structured decision-making framework. This case study suggests that our open-source tool can be useful to guide wildlife conservation decisions by explicitly estimating costs and benefits associated with recovery actions, which ultimately helps to bridge the gap between management and science via increased accessible application of current knowledge.},

  abstract = {Habitat loss is often the ultimate cause of species endangerment and is also a leading factor inhibiting species recovery. For this reason, species-at-risk legislation, policies and plans typically focus on habitat conservation and restoration as mechanisms for recovery. To assess the effectiveness of these instruments in decelerating habitat loss, we evaluated spatiotemporal habitat changes for an iconic endangered species, woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). We quantified changes in forest cover, a key proxy of caribou habitat, for all caribou subpopulations in Alberta and British Columbia, Canada. Despite efforts under federal and provincial recovery plans, and requirements listed under Canada's Species at Risk Act, caribou subpopulations lost twice as much habitat as they gained during a 12-year period (2000{\textendash}2012). Drivers of habitat loss varied by ecotype, with Boreal and Northern Mountain caribou affected most by forest fire and Southern Mountain caribou affected more by forest harvest. Our case study emphasizes critical gaps between recovery planning and habitat management actions, which are a core expectation under most species-at-risk legislation. Loss of caribou habitat from 2000 to 2018 has accelerated. Linear features within caribou ranges have also increased over time, particularly seismic lines within Boreal caribou ranges, and we estimated that only 5\% of seismic lines have functionally regenerated. Our findings support the idea that short-term recovery actions such as predator reductions and translocations will likely just delay caribou extinction in the absence of well-considered habitat management. Given the magnitude of ongoing habitat change, it is clear that unless the cumulative impacts of land-uses are effectively addressed through planning and management actions that consider anthropogenic and natural disturbances, we will fail to achieve self-sustaining woodland caribou populations across much of North America.},

The extent of occurrence of the threatened boreal population of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou; caribou) has contracted due to environmental and anthropogenic disruption, with further contractions predicted as boreal habitat shifts with the changing climate. However, the direct and indirect climate drivers of caribou extent of occurrence have not been explicitly investigated. We estimated and compared the influence of climate and habitat drivers on the occurrence of caribou ranges across the Canadian boreal forest. We fit path models that estimated the direct effects of climate on caribou range occurrence and its indirect effect through climate's influence on caribou habitat (i.e., forest cover, presence of peatland, human disturbance and wildfire). Our analysis suggests that the distribution of caribou ranges is less sensitive to the direct effects of climate than to those of habitat and human disturbance. However, through its relationship to caribou habitat, climate exerts indirect influence over the distribution of caribou. As the climate changes, future distributions of caribou may be more heavily relegated to refuge habitats, particularly peatlands in the western boreal forest. Our biogeographical approach enables more informed decisions for large-scale caribou conservation efforts (e.g. establishment of protected areas, habitat restoration) that account for potential shifts in the distribution of caribou under changing environmental and climatic conditions.},

  abstract = {The most widely reported threat to boreal and mountain populations of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou; caribou) involves habitat- or disturbance-mediated apparent competition (DMAC). With DMAC, natural and anthropogenic disturbances that increase the abundance of deciduous-browsing cervids (e.g., moose [Alces alces], deer [Odocoileus spp.]) are thought to promote predator (especially wolf [Canis lupus]) numbers, which heightens predation risk to caribou. We know most about the effects of DMAC on caribou where the species is under threat by anthropogenic activities in relatively productive southern boreal and mountain systems. Yet, {$>$}60\% of extant boreal caribou range in North America consists of northern shield and taiga ecoregions of low productivity where caribou may compete with only 1 ungulate species (moose) in the context of DMAC. In this environment, we know very little of how DMAC acts as a limiting factor to caribou. In Saskatchewan, Canada, from 2014{\textendash}2018, using a combination of vegetation sampling, aerial surveys, and telemetry data (n = 38 wolves), we searched for evidence of DMAC (trends in data consistent with the hypothesis) in an 87,193-km2 section of the Western Boreal Shield, a poorly productive but pristine region (0.18\% of land cover classed as an anthropogenic feature) with a historically high fire-return interval (47\% of stands aged {$<$}40 years). Despite the high levels of disturbance, moose density was relatively low (47 moose/1,000 km2), likely because of the scarcity of deciduous or mixed-wood stands and low abundance of deciduous browse in the young conifer stands that dominated the landscape. In contrast, boreal caribou density was relatively high for the species (37 caribou/1,000 km2). Wolf density (3.1 wolves/1,000 km2) and pack sizes (urn:x-wiley:0022541X:media:jwmg21982:jwmg21982-math-0001 = 4.0 wolves/pack) were low and resident (established) territories were large (urn:x-wiley:0022541X:media:jwmg21982:jwmg21982-math-0002 = 4,360 km2; 100\% minimum convex polygon). The low density of wolves mirrored the low (standardized) ungulate biomass index (UBI; moose + boreal caribou) of the study area (0.36 UBI/km2). We conclude that wolf and hence caribou populations were not responding in accordance with the outcomes generally predicted by DMAC in our study area because the requisite strong, positive response to fire of deciduous-browse and alternate-prey abundance was lacking. As a limiting factor to caribou, DMAC is likely modulated at a macroecological scale by factors such as net primary productivity, a corollary to the general hypothesis that we advance here (i.e., primary productivity hypothesis of DMAC). We caution against managing for caribou based on the presumption of DMAC where the mechanism does not apply, which may include much of boreal caribou range in the north. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Wildlife Society.},

  abstract = {We investigate the dynamics and the asymptotic profiles of positive steady states of a specialist predator-prey model and a generalist predator-prey model in closed advective environments. The threshold dynamics are determined by the mortality rate of the specialist predators and the predation rate of the generalist predators, respectively. We demonstrate that, no matter how large advection and diffusion rates are, the specialist predators can successfully invade as long as the mortality rate is sufficiently small, while the generalist predators can take-over the prey if the predation rate is relatively large. Finally, we explore the impacts of diffusion and advection on the asymptotic profiles of positive steady states. Our results imply that large advection rates and small diffusion rates will lead to the concentration of the species at the downstream or the upstream. Moreover, if the diffusion rates are large, then the densities of the species will be less spatial heterogeneous.},

A key obstacle to harnessing their potential is the great cost of having humans analyze each image. Here, we demonstrate that a cutting-edge type of artificial intelligence called deep neural networks can automatically extract such invaluable information. For example, we show deep learning can automate animal identification for 99.3\% of the 3.2 million-image Snapshot Serengeti dataset while performing at the same 96.6\% accuracy of crowdsourced teams of human volunteers. Automatically, accurately, and inexpensively collecting such data could help catalyze the transformation of many fields of ecology, wildlife biology, zoology, conservation biology, and animal behavior into ``big data'' sciences.           ,              Having accurate, detailed, and up-to-date information about the location and behavior of animals in the wild would improve our ability to study and conserve ecosystems. We investigate the ability to automatically, accurately, and inexpensively collect such data, which could help catalyze the transformation of many fields of ecology, wildlife biology, zoology, conservation biology, and animal behavior into ``big data'' sciences. Motion-sensor ``camera traps'' enable collecting wildlife pictures inexpensively, unobtrusively, and frequently. However, extracting information from these pictures remains an expensive, time-consuming, manual task. We demonstrate that such information can be automatically extracted by deep learning, a cutting-edge type of artificial intelligence. We train deep convolutional neural networks to identify, count, and describe the behaviors of 48 species in the 3.2 million-image Snapshot Serengeti dataset. Our deep neural networks automatically identify animals with {$>$}93.8\% accuracy, and we expect that number to improve rapidly in years to come. More importantly, if our system classifies only images it is confident about, our system can automate animal identification for 99.3\% of the data while still performing at the same 96.6\% accuracy as that of crowdsourced teams of human volunteers, saving {$>$}8.4 y (i.e., {$>$}17,000 h at 40 h/wk) of human labeling effort on this 3.2 million-image dataset. Those efficiency gains highlight the importance of using deep neural networks to automate data extraction from camera-trap images, reducing a roadblock for this widely used technology. Our results suggest that deep learning could enable the inexpensive, unobtrusive, high-volume, and even real-time collection of a wealth of information about vast numbers of animals in the wild.},

  abstract = {Habitat selection is a fundamental animal behavior that shapes a wide range of ecological processes, including animal movement, nutrient transfer, trophic dynamics and population distribution. Although habitat selection has been a focus of ecological studies for decades, technological, conceptual and methodological advances over the last 20 yr have led to a surge in studies addressing this process. Despite the substantial literature focused on quantifying the habitat-selection patterns of animals, there is a marked lack of guidance on best analytical practices. The conceptual foundations of the most commonly applied modeling frameworks can be confusing even to those well versed in their application. Furthermore, there has yet to be a synthesis of the advances made over the last 20 yr. Therefore, there is a need for both synthesis of the current state of knowledge on habitat selection, and guidance for those seeking to study this process. Here, we provide an approachable overview and synthesis of the literature on habitat-selection analyses (HSAs) conducted using selection functions, which are by far the most applied modeling framework for understanding the habitat-selection process. This review is purposefully non-technical and focused on understanding without heavy mathematical and statistical notation, which can confuse many practitioners. We offer an overview and history of HSAs, describing the tortuous conceptual path to our current understanding. Through this overview, we also aim to address the areas of greatest confusion in the literature. We synthesize the literature outlining the most exciting conceptual advances in the field of habitat-selection modeling, discussing the substantial ecological and evolutionary inference that can be made using contemporary techniques. We aim for this paper to provide clarity for those navigating the complex literature on HSAs while acting as a reference and best practices guide for practitioners.},

The results indicate that the prediction of Oksanenet al. (1981) of strict predation limitation of herbivores in productive ecosystems does not hold for coevolved systems. Depending on the nature of herbivore-carnivore coevolution, herbivore biomass may level off at a threshold productivity value or increase monotonously with increasing primary productivity, though at a strongly reduced rate in productive ecosystems. Under both circumstances, increasing primary productivity is predicted to be accompanied by gradual replacement of genuine folivores by semi-granivores and true granivores. The dominating guild members are predicted to show some degree of resource-limitation, although only granivores are predicted to be chiefly resource-limited even in the most productive ecosystems. Data on arctic-to-temperate patterns in the community structure of herbivorous vertebrates conform to the implications of the analysis.},

  abstract = {Hypotheses on trophic dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems fall into two major categories: those in which plants are assumed to be invulnerable to their consumers and those in which the build-up of plant biomass is assumed to require top-down control of folivores. The hypothesis of exploitation ecosystems (EEH) belongs to the latter category and focuses particularly on the consequences of the high energetic costs of maintenance of endotherms. Carnivorous endotherms require relatively high prey densities in order to break even. Moreover, they are dependent on folivorous prey during the limiting season, at least at high latitudes. The endotherm branch of the grazing web is thus predicted to collapse from three-link trophic dynamics (carnivores {\textrightarrow} folivores {\textrightarrow} plants {\textrightarrow} inorganic resources) to two-link dynamics (folivores {\textrightarrow} plants {\textrightarrow} inorganic resources) along gradients of decreasing primary productivity. Consequently, the vegetation of cold and unproductive areas is predicted to be under intense winter grazing pressure, which prevents the accumulation of aboveground plant biomass and excludes erect woody plants. In the most extreme habitats (e.g., polar deserts and their high alpine counterparts), even folivorous endotherms are predicted to be absent, and the scanty vegetation is predicted to be structured by preemptive competition. Within temperature-determined productivity gradients, EEH is corroborated by biomass patterns, by patterns in the structure and dynamics of carnivore, folivore, and plant communities, and by experimental results. The general idea of top-down trophic dynamics is supported for other autotroph-based systems, too, but the relevance and sufficiency of the energy constraint in explaining patterns in trophic dynamics appears to be variable. Moreover, critical empirical evidence for or against the capacity of folivorous insects to regulate plant biomass has not yet been obtained. Another open question is the ability of boreal and temperate browsers, evolved in productive environments with intense predation pressure and abundance of forage, to prevent the regeneration of the least palatable tree species. There are, thus, many open questions waiting to be answered and many exciting experiments waiting to be conducted.},

Others have two trophic level dynamics (food limited herbivores; plants adapted to tackle intense herbivory) or one trophic level dynamic (herbivorous endotherms absent, thus plants compete for the few places where they can survive and grow). According to the Exploitation Ecosystems Hypothesis (EEH), these contrasting dynamics are consequences of differences in primary productivity. The productivity thresholds for changing food web dynamics were assumed to be global constants. We challenged this assumption and found that several model parameters are sensitive to the contrast between persistently warm and seasonally cold climates. In persistently warm environments, three trophic level dynamics can be expected to prevail almost everywhere, save the most extreme deserts. We revised EEH accordingly and tested it by compiling direct evidence of three and two trophic level dynamics and by studying the global distribution of felids. In seasonally cold environments, we found evidence for three trophic level dynamics only in productive ecosystems, while evidence for two trophic level dynamics appeared in ecosystems with low primary productivity. In persistently warm environments, we found evidence for three trophic level dynamics in all types of ecosystems. The distribution of felids corroborated these results. The empirical evidence thus indicates that two trophic level dynamics, as defined by EEH, are restricted to seasonally cold biomes with low primary productivity, such as the artic{\textendash}alpine tundra and the temperate steppe.},

We estimated habitat availability for each of 22 radiomarked, adult female moose and divided the animals into 2 groups based on the similarity of relative habitat class abundances. We measured habitat preference for individual moose from each group during 2 seasons in each of 2 years using a simple resource selection function (RSF). We used analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare differences between groups. Preference of several habitat classes differed between groups, indicating that habitat preferences of moose are not fixed and change as the relative abundance of available habitat changes.

Through two complementary short-term experiments, we assessed how local and large-scale environmental conditions affect a subtropical intertidal predator{\textendash}prey interaction. At a local scale, we evaluated the effects of the degree of exposure to wave action and prey density on consumption rate and interaction strength using a whelk{\textendash}barnacle system. Consumption rate decreased with wave exposure at experimentally reduced prey density but did not change at ambient density. Such an interactive effect occurred due to shifts in the whelk's feeding behaviour, likely linked to encounter rate and stress amelioration underpinned by prey density. Per capita interaction strength of the whelk on the barnacle weakened along the wave exposure gradient, but to a greater degree at reduced compared to ambient prey density. This confirms that environmental harshness can decrease the importance of predators, but the magnitude of change may be modified by density-dependent effects. A large-scale experiment did not reveal spatial patterns in the whelk{\textendash}barnacle interaction, nor relationships to chlorophyll-a concentration or the minor change in sea temperature across the study area. Patterns in the size of consumed barnacles along the chlorophyll-a gradient suggest changes in food choice related to prey quality and size. We conclude that disentangling the effects of wave exposure and prey density revealed important potential mechanisms driving species locally. Large-scale variation in the whelk{\textendash}barnacle interaction appeared to be linked to species' traits shaped by the environmental context.},

Monte Carlo simulations involving a model of adult surviva l and fawn recruitment supported the results of the deer pellet-group inventories and suggested low but positiv e rates of increase for both populations. Although predation and the unregistered harvest of adult females probabl y slowed the growth of deer populations following the decline, the recent establishment of a zone-based antlerles s harvest quota system should allow managers to regulate deer numbers by annually adjusting the number of antle r - less permits in response to estimates of hunting and nonhunting losses.},

  abstract = {The behavior of many wild animals remains a mystery, as it is difficult to quantify behavior of species that cannot be easily followed throughout their daily or seasonal movements. Accelerometers can solve some of these mysteries, as they collect activity data at a high temporal resolution ({$<$}1 s), can be relatively small ({$<$}1 g) so they minimally disrupt behavior, and are increasingly capable of recording data for long periods. Nonetheless, there is a need for increased validation of methods to classify animal behavior from accelerometers to promote widespread adoption of this technology in ecology. We assessed the accuracy of six different behavioral assignment methods for two species of seabird, thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia) and black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla). We identified three behaviors using tri-axial accelerometers: standing, swimming, and flying, after classifying diving using a pressure sensor for murres. We evaluated six classification methods relative to independent classifications from concurrent GPS tracking data. We used four variables for classification: depth, wing beat frequency, pitch, and dynamic acceleration. Average accuracy for all methods was {$>$}98\% for murres, and 89\% and 93\% for kittiwakes during incubation and chick rearing, respectively. Variable selection showed that classification accuracy did not improve with more than two (kittiwakes) or three (murres) variables. We conclude that simple methods of behavioral classification can be as accurate for classifying basic behaviors as more complex approaches, and that identifying suitable accelerometer metrics is more important than using a particular classification method when the objective is to develop a daily activity or energy budget. Highly accurate daily activity budgets can be generated from accelerometer data using multiple methods and a small number of accelerometer metrics; therefore, identifying a suitable behavioral classification method should not be a barrier to using accelerometers in studies of seabird behavior and ecology.},

  abstract = {A variety of responses to climate change have been reported for northern tree populations, primarily from tree-ring and satellite-based studies. Here we employ provenance data to examine growth and survival responses of northern populations (defined here as those occurring north of 52{\textdegree} N) of black spruce (Picea mariana) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana) to southward seed transfers. This space for time substitution affords insights into potential climate change responses by these important northern tree species. Based on previous work, we anticipated relatively flat response curves that peak at much warmer temperatures than those found at seed source origin. These expectations were generally met for growth-related responses, with peak growth associated with seed transfers to environments with mean annual temperatures 2.2 and 3.6 {\textdegree}C warmer than seed source origin for black spruce and jack pine, respectively. These findings imply that northern tree populations harbor a significant amount of resilience to climate warming. However, survival responses told a different story, with both species exhibiting reduced survival rates when moved to warmer and drier environments. Together with the growth-based results, these findings suggest that the warmer and drier conditions expected across much of northern Canada under climate change may reduce survival, but surviving trees may grow at a faster rate up until a certain magnitude of climate warming has been reached. We note that all relationships had high levels of unexplained variation, underlining the many factors that may influence provenance study outcomes and the challenges in predicting tree responses to climate change. Despite certain limitations, we feel that the provenance data employed here provide valuable insights into potential climate change outcomes for northern tree populations.},

Snowshoe hares and lynx are both well-suited for snowy winters, but climate change-associated shifts in snow conditions could lower hare survival and alter cyclic dynamics. Using detailed monitoring of snowshoe hare cause-specific mortality, behaviour and prevailing weather, we demonstrate that hare mortality risk is strongly influenced by variation in snow conditions. Although predation risk from lynx was largely unaffected by snow conditions, coyote (Canis latrans) predation increased in shallow snow. Maximum snow depth in our study area has decreased 33\% over the last two decades and predictions based on prolonged shallow snow indicate that future hare survival could resemble that seen during population declines. Our results indicate that climate change could disrupt cyclic dynamics in the boreal forest.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of species composition and their interactions, in the form of interaction networks, is required to understand processes shaping their distribution over time and space. As such, comparing ecological networks along environmental gradients represents a promising new research avenue to understand the organization of life. Variation in the position and intensity of links within networks along environmental gradients may be driven by turnover in species composition, by variation in species abundances and by abiotic influences on species interactions. While investigating changes in species composition has a long tradition, so far only a limited number of studies have examined changes in species interactions between networks, often with differing approaches. Here, we review studies investigating variation in network structures along environmental gradients, highlighting how methodological decisions about standardization can influence their conclusions. Due to their complexity, variation among ecological networks is frequently studied using properties that summarize the distribution or topology of interactions such as number of links, connectance, or modularity. These properties can either be compared directly or using a procedure of standardization. While measures of network structure can be directly related to changes along environmental gradients, standardization is frequently used to facilitate interpretation of variation in network properties by controlling for some co-variables, or via null models. Null models allow comparing the deviation of empirical networks from random expectations and are expected to provide a more mechanistic understanding of the factors shaping ecological networks when they are coupled with functional traits. As an illustration, we compare approaches to quantify the role of trait matching in driving the structure of plant{\textendash}hummingbird mutualistic networks, i.e. a direct comparison, standardized by null models and hypothesis-based metaweb. Overall, our analysis warns against a comparison of studies that rely on distinct forms of standardization, as they are likely to highlight different signals. Fostering a better understanding of the analytical tools available and the signal they detect will help produce deeper insights into how and why ecological networks vary along environmental gradients.},

The current unstoppable changes in the stoichiometries of C and N relative to P have no historical precedent. We describe changes in P and N fluxes over the last five decades that have led to asymmetrical increases in P and N inputs to the biosphere. We identified widespread and rapid changes in N:P ratios in air, soil, water, and organisms and important consequences to the structure, function, and biodiversity of ecosystems. A mass-balance approach found that the combined limited availability of P and N was likely to reduce C storage by natural ecosystems during the remainder of the 21st Century, and projected crop yields of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment indicated an increase in nutrient deficiency in developing regions if access to P fertilizer is limited. Imbalances of the N:P ratio would likely negatively affect human health, food security, and global economic and geopolitical stability, with feedbacks and synergistic effects on drivers of global environmental change, such as increasing levels of CO2, climatic warming, and increasing pollution. We summarize potential solutions for avoiding the negative impacts of global imbalances of N:P ratios on the environment, biodiversity, climate change, food security, and human health.},

We developed allometric equations to predict available browse biomass for individual plants and subsequent biomass estimates in 6 major cover types to estimate the moose carrying capacity within the Park. Our model incorporated the differential availability and nutritional quality of woody browse species within each cover type and changes in local browsing intensity due to competing vegetation under two different foraging constraints {\textendash} protein and digestible energy. We estimated the carrying capacity as 8 (protein constraint) and 135 {\texttimes} (energy constraint) greater in winter than summer. Spatially-explicit estimates of summer range capacity (Animal Use Days, AUD) based on the protein constraint correlated best with variation in local moose density derived from winter aerial surveys (R2 = 0.75, P \&lt; 0.01, n = 18). Protein availability was limiting in summer (AUD = 457 moose) with sparse patches of regenerating forest (\&lt; 20 years old) on privately-managed lands estimated to support 86\% more moose than the dominant matrix of wetlands and mature mixed-deciduous forest. The small and patchy moose population in the Park reflects the relative scarcity of regenerating forest and optimal foraging habitat. Given statutory constraints of timber harvest in the majority of the Park, active forest management on private inholdings will play an outsized role in managing the moose population.},

  abstract = {Although networks provide a powerful approach to study a large variety of ecological systems, their formulation does not typically account for multiple interaction types, interactions that vary in space and time, and interconnected systems such as networks of networks. The emergent field of `multilayer networks' provides a natural framework for extending analyses of ecological systems to include such multiple layers of complexity, as it specifically allows one to differentiate and model `intralayer' and `interlayer' connectivity. The framework provides a set of concepts and tools that can be adapted and applied to ecology, facilitating research on high-dimensional, heterogeneous systems in nature. Here, we formally define ecological multilayer networks based on a review of previous and related approaches, illustrate their application and potential with analyses of existing data, and discuss limitations, challenges, and future applications. The integration of multilayer network theory into ecology offers largely untapped potential to further address ecological complexity, to ultimately provide new theoretical and empirical insights into the architecture and dynamics of ecological systems.},

However, transient bottom-up effects resulting from resource pulses can lead to sequential shifts in the strength of top{\textendash}down predator effects. We used a large-scale field experiment (32 small islands sampled over 5 years) to probe how the frequency and magnitude of pulsed seaweed inputs drives temporal variation in the top{\textendash}down effects of lizard predators. Short-term weakening of lizard effects on spiders and plants (the latter via a trophic cascade) were associated with lizard diet shifts, and were more pronounced with larger seaweed inputs. Long-term strengthening of lizard effects was associated with lizard numerical responses and plant fertilisation. Increased pulse frequency reinforced the strengthening of lizard effects on spiders and plants. These results underscore the temporally variable nature of top{\textendash}down effects and highlight the role of resource pulses in driving this variation.},

Ungulates often serve as a significant source of prey for many large mammal predators, and patterns of predation are known to influence population dynamics. Although black bear and wolf diets have been investigated extensively, prey preference has been less commonly examined, especially in analyses that take into account age class (i.e., juvenile and adult) of the ungulate prey. We examined black bear (Ursus americanus), wolf (Canis lupus), and hybrids (Canis spp.) prey preference in Ontario based on the availability of three ungulate species{\textemdash}elk (Cervus elaphus), moose (Alces alces), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We analyzed the presence of prey items in black bear and wolf scats collected over 3 years by examining prey hair cuticular scale patterns. We applied correction factors to frequencies of occurrence of prey items found in predator scat and related diet composition to the availability of ungulates, determined by fecal pellet transect surveys. In addition, non-ungulate diet items were identified to obtain full diet composition profiles. We found that black bear diet consisted of more than 87\% vegetation, and they were opportunistic, not selecting for any particular ungulate species in either adult or juvenile age class. Wolf diet was comprised mainly of ungulates ({\textasciitilde} 73.2\%), muskrat (Ondatra zibethica; {\textasciitilde} 8.5\%), and beaver (Castor canadensis; {\textasciitilde} 14.6\%), and although moose were at least 1.5 times more abundant then each of the other ungulate prey species in the study area, wolves preferred elk, using moose less than expected. Although we found black bear diet to be opportunistic during the summer, wolves in our study heavily utilized both juvenile and adult ungulates, however, among ungulate species, displayed preference for elk. The preference displayed by wolves provides insight that wildlife managers can use to guide further investigation and assist with the development of strategies to ensure continued elk reintroduction success, and moose and white-tailed deer population sustainability.},

Therefore, I predicted the carrying capacity and population dynamics of the wolf in the Netherlands, and studied the effects of habitat fragmentation and climate change. The effects of climate change on soil processes, vegetation structure and prey abundance for wolves were simulated with the models SMART2 and SUMO2. I assessed the effects of habitat fragmentation by comparing a scenario with and without wildlife overpasses. Population dynamics were simulated applying the model METAPHOR. Due to climate change, primary productivity increased, resulting in higher prey availability. Wolf carrying capacity and population dynamics are hence positively affected by climate change, although the effect was smaller than for habitat fragmentation. The average number of adults after a 110 year model run more than doubled in the presence of overpasses compared to the scenario without. Population persistence is negatively affected by habitat fragmentation. This study indicates the importance of overpasses for carnivores, which therefore should be an integrated part of nature management.},

A model developed to simulate the effect of changes in the original values showed that the estimated carrying capacity could vary between 0 and 18 deer/km2 depending on sinking depth of deer in a severe winter. Because of the variability of winter conditions, mainly snow depth and length of confinement period, the deer manager should refer to a "desirable stocking rate" for average climatic conditions. Based on this principle, the desirable population in the area studied should be maintained between 15 and 28 deer/km2. The sensitivity of the model to variations in the original values was tested and the possible strategies for deer and the deer manager are discussed.},

Moose (Alces alces) is a pan-boreal herbivore experiencing population declines across large portions of North America; however, the species has shown variable response to climate across its distribution. We investigated moose demographic response to climate and evaluated the interacting role of habitat across 36 years and along a biogeographic gradient in Ontario, Canada that has experienced decadal changes to climate and habitat quality. Moose density exhibited a nonlinear trend that initially increased and then decreased over the study timeframe and was negatively affected by regional and local patterns of winter severity and later frost onset. Recruitment exhibited a monotonic decline and was positively affected by spring heat and deciduous forest cover, while also exhibiting density-dependent effects. The negative response of moose density to winter severity was reduced in Wildlife Management Units (WMUs) with higher proportions of dense canopy cover, supporting expectations that this habitat type improves moose winter mobility and predator avoidance. The negative effect of later frost onset was greater in WMUs with more regenerating forest, and both variables are associated with higher exposure to parasites and predators. Further, density-dependent effects on recruitment were suppressed by warmer springs that support vegetation productivity and in WMUs with higher proportions of dense canopy cover that can provide concealment from predators. Our study illustrates the important role habitat conditions can have to mitigate, or exacerbate, climate-change effects for a wide-spread herbivore occupying variable environments by potentially altering pathways relevant to energetic balance, predation, and parasite transmission. In this system, moose occupying sparse or regenerating forests are more susceptible to adverse climatic effects and should be managed accordingly.},

  abstract = {Movement is a key process driving animal distributions within heterogeneous landscapes. Graph (network) theory is increasingly used to understand and predict landscape functional connectivity, as network properties can provide crucial information regarding the resilience of a system to landscape disturbances, e.g. removal of habitat patches. The temporal dimension of movement patterns, however, is not generally included in network analysis, which can lead to a discrepancy between observed space use and landscape connectivity. Reaction{\textendash}advection{\textendash}diffusion models, when coupled with network analysis, could provide a powerful mechanistic framework based upon spatio-temporal dimensions of animal movement, but this approach remains poorly developed for ecological studies. We developed a mechanistic space use model that considers both residency time in resource patches and movement amongst those patches within a spatial network. The framework involves two main steps: first, the network topology that best reflects functional connectivity for the study system is identified; second, a spatio-temporal flow dynamic is implemented within the network using reaction{\textendash}advection{\textendash}diffusion modelling. To illustrate the approach, we used observations of radiocollared plains bison Bison bison bison that were travelling in a meadow network within a forest matrix. In the model application, we found that the graph best reflecting the functional connectivity of bison was a complex graph of ultra-small world scale-free network type. The reaction{\textendash}advection{\textendash}diffusion model involved the effect of meadow area and inter-meadow distance on bison travels. Simulations showed that a simple graph or distance-based graphs provided less accurate predictions of bison distribution, while also predicting different management actions to effectively impact bison space use. Our study demonstrates how reaction{\textendash}advection{\textendash}diffusion modelling, coupled with network theory, can provide a robust mechanistic framework for predicting animal distribution in dynamic environments. The modelling approach can be applied to a large range of systems that are subjected to rapid environmental changes due to habitat management or natural resource extraction, for example. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that management and conservation planning can strongly depend upon network structure, and that a faulty assessment of network topology can result in poor planning, with potential unexpected impacts on animal distributions.},

  abstract = {Network theory increasingly informs wildlife conservation in disturbed landscapes, but with concern increasingly expressed about its application to real-world situations. The theory predicts that the connectivity of scale-free networks should be particularly sensitive to the disturbance of highly connected nodes (i.e. hubs). This expectation relies on complete patch removal, thus restraining its application to the last of several steps involved in habitat fragmentation, and overlooks potential reconnection of patches after disturbance (i.e. rewiring). We performed a landscape-scale experiment to evaluate the robustness of scale-free spatial networks of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) to logging activity. We built caribou networks before and after disturbance using a mechanistic model of inter-patch movements and differentiated networks disturbed in their hubs and non-hubs. We applied a reaction{\textendash}advection{\textendash}diffusion model to networks before and after disturbance to account for the spatio-temporal dynamics of caribou movement within the networks and anticipate their space use. We validated network and space-use predictions using empirical estimates from GPS relocations of caribou. Using the validated predictions, we compared topological network measures before and after disturbance to quantify changes in connectivity within the networks according to the type of disturbed nodes (i.e. hubs or non-hubs) and assessed space-use reorganization. We used control networks, for which no disturbance occurred in the before{\textendash}after timeframe of the study, in the latter analysis to get a baseline rate of change. Disturbances due to logging activity typically resulted in fragmentation and shrinkage instead of complete patch removal. Independently to the type of disturbed nodes, caribou rewired their network using remnant patches from the fragmentation process. Consequently, topological network measures generally did not differ between before and after disturbance, such that caribou networks displayed some robustness to logging activity due to the rewiring process. Space-use reorganization was greater, however, when hubs were disturbed in comparison with non-hubs and controls. Even though caribou rewired their networks, they revisited less patches after the disturbance of hubs. A naive application of network theory (i.e. without potential rewiring and using complete patch removal), to assess spatial network robustness, may be inappropriate during most steps of the fragmentation process because of the rewiring process. Indeed, network rewiring facilitated by the presence of remnant patches can enhance spatial network robustness, in comparison with no rewiring. In addition, species-specific functional connectivity should be accounted for when anticipating the rewiring process and animal space use within disturbed networks.

  abstract = {Movement of organisms plays a fundamental role in the evolution and diversity of life. Animals typically move at an irregular pace over time and space, alternating among movement states. Understanding movement decisions and developing mechanistic models of animal distribution dynamics can thus be contingent to adequate discrimination of behavioral phases. Existing methods to disentangle movement states typically require a follow-up analysis to identify state-dependent drivers of animal movement, which overlooks statistical uncertainty that comes with the state delineation process. Here, we developed population-level, multi-state step selection functions (HMM-SSF) that can identify simultaneously the different behavioral bouts and the specific underlying behavior-habitat relationship. Using simulated data and relocation data from mule deer (               Odocoileus hemionus               ), plains bison (               Bison bison bison               ) and plains zebra (               Equus quagga               ), we illustrated the HMM-SSF robustness, versatility, and predictive ability for animals involved in distinct behavioral processes: foraging, migrating and avoiding a nearby predator. Individuals displayed different habitat selection pattern during the encamped and the travelling phase. Some landscape attributes switched from being selected to avoided, depending on the movement phase. We further showed that HMM-SSF can detect multi-modes of movement triggered by predators, with prey switching to the travelling phase when predators are in close vicinity. HMM-SSFs thus can be used to gain a mechanistic understanding of how animals use their environment in relation to the complex interplay between their needs to move, their knowledge of the environment and navigation capacity, their motion capacity and the external factors related to landscape heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {Understanding how habitat and nutritional condition affect ungulate populations is necessary for informing management, particularly in areas experiencing carnivore recovery and declining ungulate population trends. Variations in forage species availability, plant phenological stage, and the abundance of forage make it challenging to understand landscape-level effects of nutrition on ungulates. We developed an integrated spatial modeling approach to estimate landscape-level elk (Cervus elaphus) nutritional resources in two adjacent study areas that differed in coarse measures of habitat quality and related the consequences of differences in nutritional resources to elk body condition and pregnancy rates. We found no support for differences in dry matter digestibility between plant samples or in phenological stage based on ground sampling plots in the two study areas. Our index of nutritional resources, measured as digestible forage biomass, varied among land cover types and between study areas. We found that altered plant composition following fires was the biggest driver of differences in nutritional resources, suggesting that maintaining a mosaic of fire history and distribution will likely benefit ungulate populations. Study area, lactation status, and year affected fall body fat of adult female elk. Elk in the study area exposed to lower summer range nutritional resources had lower nutritional condition entering winter. These differences in nutritional condition resulted in differences in pregnancy rate, with average pregnancy rates of 89\% for elk exposed to higher nutritional resources and 72\% for elk exposed to lower nutritional resources. Summer range nutritional resources have the potential to limit elk pregnancy rate and calf production, and these nutritional limitations may predispose elk to be more sensitive to the effects of harvest or predation. Wildlife managers should identify ungulate populations that are nutritionally limited and recognize that these populations may be more impacted by recovering carnivores or harvest than populations inhabiting more productive summer habitats.}

We used an observational before-after-control-treatment approach to evaluate a case study in west-central Montana, USA, that applied conservative ungulate harvest together with liberalized carnivore harvest to achieve short-term decreases in carnivore abundance and increases in ungulate recruitment. Our study areas included the Bitterroot treatment area and the Clark Fork control area, where mountain lion populations (Felis concolor) were managed for a 30\% reduction and for stability, respectively. The goals of the mountain lion harvest were to provide a short-term reduction of mountain lion predation on elk (Cervus canadensis) calves and an increase in elk recruitment, elk population growth rate, and ultimately elk abundance. We estimated mountain lion population abundance in the Bitterroot treatment and Clark Fork control areas before and 4 years after implementation of the 2012 harvest treatment. We developed a multi-strata spatial capture-recapture model that integrated recapture and telemetry data to evaluate mountain lion population responses to harvest changes. Mountain lion abundance declined with increasing harvest in the Bitterroot treatment area from 161 (90\% credible interval [CrI] = 104, 233) to 115 (CrI = 69, 173). The proportion of males changed from 0.50 (CrI = 0.33, 0.67) to 0.28 (CrI = 0.17, 0.40), which translated into a decline in the abundance of males, and similar abundances of females (before: males = 80 [CrI = 52, 116], females = 81 [CrI = 52, 117]; after: males = 33 [CrI = 20, 49], females = 82 [CrI = 49, 124]). In the Clark Fork control area, an area twice as large as the Bitterroot treatment area, we found no evidence of changes in overall abundance or proportion of males in the population. The proportion of males changed from 0.42 (CrI = 0.26, 0.58) to 0.39 (CrI = 0.25, 0.54), which translated into similar abundances of males and females (before: males = 24 [CrI = 16, 36], females = 33 [CrI = 21, 39]; after: males = 28 [CrI = 18, 41], females = 44 [CrI = 29, 64]). To evaluate if elk recruitment and population growth rate increased following treatment, we developed an integrated elk population model. We compared recruitment and population growth rate during the 5 years prior to and 5 years following implementation of the mountain lion harvest treatment for 2 elk populations within the Bitterroot treatment area and 2 elk populations within the Clark Fork control area. We found strong evidence that temporal trends differed between the 2 areas. In the Bitterroot treatment area, per capita elk recruitment was stable around an estimated median value of 0.23 (CrI = 0.17, 0.36) in the pre-treatment period (2007{\textendash}2011), increased immediately after treatment (2013) to 0.42 (CrI = 0.29, 0.56), and then declined to 0.21 (CrI = 0.11, 0.32) in 2017. In contrast, per capita elk recruitment estimates in the Clark Fork control area had similar median values during the pre- (2007{\textendash}2011: 0.30, CrI = 0.2, 0.35) and post-treatment periods (2013{\textendash}2017: 0.31, CrI = 0.26, 0.36). These changes in recruitment corresponded to similar changes in elk population growth rate, although population growth rates were also subject to variation due to changing elk harvest. In the Bitterroot treatment area, population growth rates in the pre-treatment period were stable to slightly declining, with an estimated median value of 0.92 (CrI = 0.88, 1.07) in the pre-treatment period (2007{\textendash}2011). Population growth rate during the post-treatment period increased immediately after treatment (2012: 1.17, CrI = 1.14, 1.20) prior to declining to 1.06 (CrI = 1.04, 1.09) in 2016. In contrast, the median population growth rates were roughly equal in the Clark Fork control area during the pre-treatment period (1.01, CrI = 0.86, 1.09) from 2007 to 2011 and post-treatment period (1.00, CrI = 0.83, 1.15) from 2013 to 2017. Together, these results indicate that the harvest treatment achieved a moderate (i.e., 29\%) reduction in mountain lion population abundance within the treatment area that corresponded with short-term increases in elk recruitment and population growth. Elk population demographic responses suggest that the harvest treatment effect was strongest immediately after the mountain lion harvest treatment was implemented and lessened over time as the harvest treatment was reduced. This suggests that the short-term harvest treatment resulted in short-term demographic responses in elk populations, and more sustained harvest treatments would be necessary to achieve longer-term elk population demographic responses. We recommend that wildlife managers seeking to balance carnivore and ungulate population objectives design rigorous carnivore and ungulate population monitoring programs to assess the effects of harvest management programs. Assessing and understanding effects of carnivore harvest management programs will help to set realistic expectations regarding the effects of management programs on carnivore and ungulate populations and allow managers to better design programs to meet desired carnivore and ungulate population objectives.},

  abstract = {Foragers must balance the costs and gains inherent in the pursuit of their next meal. Classical functional response formulations describe consumption rates driven by prey density and are naive to predator foraging costs. Here, we integrated foraging costs into functional responses to add mechanism and precision to foundational ideas. Specifically, using a model system with a single predator and two prey, we express a functional response emerging from variable energy and time costs of each predation phase: searching, attacking, or consuming prey. The utility of our model is explored through a focused example where prey can exert variable influence on predator foraging costs through antipredator traits. Dissimilarity between prey in their foraging costs influence the energy gain rate of the predator through optimal prey switching. We found that a small subset of prey antipredator traits and density conditions generated a stabilizing Type III (sigmoidal) functional response{\textemdash}the pattern often thought to typify a generalist predator switching between prey species. The sigmoid functional response occurred for highly profitable prey only when the costly prey (1) were at a high density and (2) their antipredator traits increased energy or time costs following an encounter. We outline testable predictions regarding foraging costs from our model. We provide guidance on how to apply optimal foraging theory to empirical scenarios where predator foraging costs vary due to prey type, predator type, or environmental conditions. Our framework represents a synergy of foundational and contemporary theory across disciplines, facilitating the discovery of shared principles and context-dependent variation across varied predator{\textendash}prey systems.},

  abstract = {Newborn offspring of animals often exhibit fully functional innate antipredator behaviors, but they may also require learning or further development to acquire appropriate responses. Experience allows offspring to modify responses to specific threats and also leaves them vulnerable during the learning period. However, antipredator behaviors used at one stage of a predator encounter may compensate for deficiencies at another stage, a phenomenon that may reduce the overall risk of young that are vulnerable at one or more stages. Few studies have examined age differences in the effectiveness of antipredator behaviors across multiple stages of a predator encounter. In this study, we examined age differences in the antipredator behaviors of California ground squirrels (Otospermophilus beecheyi) during the detection, interaction, and attack stages of Pacific rattlesnake (Crotalus oreganus) encounters. Using free-ranging squirrels, we examined the ability to detect free-ranging rattlesnakes, snake-directed behaviors after discovery of a snake, and responses to simulated rattlesnake strikes. We found that age was the most important factor in snake detection, with adults being more likely to detect snakes than pups. We also found that adults performed more tail flagging (a predator-deterrent signal) toward snakes and were more likely to investigate a snake's refuge when interacting with a hidden snake. In field experiments simulating snake strikes, adults exhibited faster reaction times than pups. Our results show that snake detection improves with age and that pups probably avoid rattlesnakes and minimize time spent in close proximity to them to compensate for their reduced reaction times to strikes.},

Having a qualitative framework to describe and estimate movement and growth based on tagging data is necessary for efficient control and management of the fishing industry. Here, we construct an advection-diffusion-reaction model for the fish population structured to track the population densities of both the tagged fish and the tag-free fish, in which the impulsive tagging practice is incorporated, while continuous tagging is assumed to be done on off springs of trackable tagged fish, or on those in the same swarm as the trackable tagged fish. Using the traveling wave coordinate, we derive analytical expression for the solutions to the model system. We derive the explicit expression for the level of tagged fish which increases in a periodic impulsive fashion. Stability and phase plane analyses are also carried out to determine different behavior permitted by the model system.},

Multiple univariate comparisons may give conflicting inferences. Therefore, aggregate validation metrics are developed in this paper. Both classical and Bayesian hypothesis testing are investigated for this purpose, using multivariate analysis. Since, commonly used statistical significance tests are based on normality assumptions, appropriate transformations are investigated in the case of non-normal data.

One of the central orienting questions in biodiversity theory and ecology is the ``paradox of the plankton'', which asks how it is possible for many species to coexist on limited resources given the tendency for competition to exclude species. Over the past five decades, ecologists have offered dozens of solutions to the paradox, invoking game theory, chaos, stochastics, and many other concepts. Despite the plentitude of solutions to the paradox, ecologists continue to offer up novel solutions. Ocean modellers are now faced with the opposite paradox: given the overabundance and the diversity of solutions to the paradox, what is the appropriate way to build coexistence into ecosystem models? Ocean ecosystem models have a very standardized form{\textemdash}nutrient{\textendash}phytoplankton{\textendash}zooplankton (NPZ)-type systems of differential equations{\textemdash}where competitive exclusion is a common model behaviour. We suggest approaching the problem from the perspective of community-level patterns. We offer a prototype for building coexistence into NPZ models. The model allows for diverse assemblages of phytoplankton or zooplankton groups to persist and produces accurate community-level patterns. The approach is simple, adding only one additional parameter, and allows us to test the effects of trait distributions and environmental variables on diversity.},

Important driving variables include animal body size and growth rate, and their relationship to reproduction and mortality. Among wild and domestic reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus), reproductive performance, calving time, calf birth weight and neonatal mortality are strongly correlated to maternal weight. Heavy females enjoy higher pregnancy rates, calve earlier, and give birth to heavier calves which have a higher neonatal survival rate than light females. Most studies indicate that both weaning weight of a calf and mature body weight correlate to its birth weight. Calf body weight and composition influence the rate of attainment of sexual maturity. Females which breed as calves suffer reduced growth and give birth to smaller calves, which suffer higher neonatal mortality and lower rates of postnatal growth. A yet unresolved question is whether reindeer body weight, and hence reproductive performance and neonatal mortality, are more strongly influenced by winter than by summer grazing conditions. This paper reviews population ecology studies on wild and domestic reindeer and promotes the view that body size in Rangifer is determined primarily by grazing conditions during the summer.},

Instead, we propose integrated modeling in the context of cumulative effects assessment using multispecies population dynamics models linked to landscape-climate simulation at large spatial and temporal scales. We developed an integrated landscape and population simulation model using ALCES Online as the model-building platform, and the model accounted for key ecological components and relationships among moose (Alces alces), grey wolves (Canis lupus nubilus), and woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in northern Ontario, Canada. We simulated multiple scenarios over 5 decades (beginning 2020) to explore sensitivity to climate change and land use and assessed effects at multiple scales. The magnitude of effect and the relative importance of key factors (climate change, roads, and habitat) differed depending on the scale of assessment. Across the full extent of the study area (654,311km2 [ecozonal scale]), the caribou population declined by 26\% largely because of climate change and associated predator-prey response, which led to caribou range recession in the southern part of the study area. At the caribou range scale (108,378 km2), which focused on 2 herds in the northern part of the study area, climate change led to a 10\% decline in the population and development led to an additional 7\% decline. At the project scale (8,331 km2), which was focused more narrowly on the landscape surrounding 4 proposed mines, the caribou population declined by 29\% largely in response to simulated development. Given that observed caribou population dynamics were sensitive to the cumulative effects of climate change, land use, interspecific interactions, and scale, insights from the analysis might not emerge under a less complex model. Our integrated modeling framework provides valuable support for broader regional assessments, including estimation of risk to caribou and Indigenous food security, and for developing and evaluating potential caribou recovery strategies. {\textcopyright} 2021 The Authors.

  abstract = {Habitat selection is a hierarchical process that may yield various patterns depending on the scales of investigation. We employed satellite radio-telemetry to examine patterns of habitat selection by female woodland caribou in central Saskatchewan at both coarse (seasonal range) and fine (daily area) scales. At each scale, we converted spatial data describing compositions of available and used habitat to standardised resource selection indices and examined them with multivariate analyses of variance. Seasonal ranges generally showed preferential inclusion of peatlands and black spruce dominated stands relative to recently disturbed stands and early seral stage forests. In all populations, caribou preferred peatlands and black spruce forests to all other habitat types at the daily area scale. In general, these patterns may reveal the effective avoidance of wolves, the primary factor limiting caribou throughout the boreal forest. In three populations where seasonal ranges showed the selective inclusion of either young jack pine stands or clearcuts along with peatlands and black spruce forests, we found a relative avoidance of the clearcuts and young jack pine stands at the daily area scale. As all caribou populations in the area are thought to be relics of a once more continuous distribution, the seasonal range selection by animals in disturbed areas may better describe historic rather than current habitat selection. We found inter-annual variation in selection at the coarser spatial scale in one population, and inter-seasonal variation in selection at the finer spatial scale in three populations, indicating that the relative grains of the spatial and temporal scales coincide. We were better able to explain the seasonal variations in finer scale selection by considering available forage, a factor less likely than predation to limit woodland caribou populations. The data agree with the theory that the spatial and temporal hierarchy of habitat selection reflects the hierarchy of factors potentially limiting individual fitness.},

Our results showed that the Atlantic-Gasp{\'e}sie caribou population consumed mainly lichens, horsetails, deciduous shrubs, and deciduous trees. We found a correlation between diet (described using stable isotope ratios) and accumulation of trace elements in hair using a redundancy analysis, and we detected relationships between diet, trace elements and vital rates using logistic and Cox models. Pregnancy and calf survival probabilities were higher when the {$\delta$}13C signature of female caribou was higher, and the adult survival probability was higher in caribou that had higher concentrations of zinc and sodium, and lower concentrations of cesium and manganese in their hair. Based on the correlation we found between nutrition and individual performance, our study suggests that nutrition may be an important factor to consider in the recovery of this endangered caribou population.},

Our results also revealed that caribou occupied a larger isotopic niche area than moose, suggesting a greater diversity of resources used by caribou. Not surprisingly, coyotes consumed mainly deer (Odocoileus virginianus), moose, snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), and occasionally caribou, while bears consumed mainly vegetation and, to a lesser extent, moose and caribou. As coyotes and bears also feed on plant species, we documented trophic niche overlap between caribou and their predators, as searching for similar resources can force them to use the same habitats and thus increase the encounter rate and, ultimately, mortality risk for caribou. Although the decline in the Gasp{\'e}sie caribou population is mostly driven by habitat-\-mediated predation, we found evidence that the low level of resource competition with moose, added to the shared resources with incidental predators, mainly bears, may contribute to jeopardize the recovery of this endangered caribou population. Highlighting the trophic interaction between species is needed to establish efficient conservation and management strategies to insure the persistence of endangered populations. The comparison of trophic niches of species sharing the same habitat or resources is fundamental to evaluate the mechanisms of coexistence or competition and eventually predict the consequences of ecosystem changes in the community.},

  abstract = {Species competing for resources also commonly share predators. While competition often drives divergence between species, the effects of shared predation are less understood. Theoretically, competing prey species could either diverge or evolve in the same direction under shared predation depending on the strength and symmetry of their interactions. We took an empirical approach to this question, comparing antipredator and trophic phenotypes between sympatric and allopatric populations of threespine stickleback and prickly sculpin fish that all live in the presence of a trout predator. We found divergence in antipredator traits between the species: in sympatry, antipredator adaptations were relatively increased in stickleback but decreased in sculpin. Shifts in feeding morphology, diet and habitat use were also divergent but driven primarily by stickleback evolution. Our results suggest that asymmetric ecological character displacement indirectly made stickleback more and sculpin less vulnerable to shared predation, driving divergence of antipredator traits between sympatric species.},

  abstract = {Effects of predators on prey habitat selection, and reciprocal effects of prey on predator habitat selection, have been analyzed using game theory. In the absence of predators, models predict that prey (e.g., herbivores) will aggregate strongly in habitats where their resources (e.g., plants) are abundant. However, game theoretic models predict that in the presence of predators, prey use of resource-rich habitats declines. Paradoxically, it is instead predators that are predicted to be mostly strongly aggregated in areas where the prey's resources (plants) are abundant, even though the predators themselves do not utilize these resources. This striking result has been dubbed the ``leapfrog effect'' by Sih (1998, 2004). Here I explore the possibility that predictions for predator and prey habitat selection are sensitive to the assumption that predators forage free from any predation risk of their own. I contrast the predictions of a 3-trophic level model with those of a 4-trophic level model, and show that incorporating the constraint imposed on ``intermediate predator'' foraging behavior by the risk of attack from ``top predators'' can produce substantial changes in model predictions. Most importantly, the leapfrog effect is largely eliminated. Top predators impose important constraints on foraging decisions made by intermediate predators, opening up new solutions for herbivores.},

There are two kinds of isolegs: some are lines of equal optimal behavior in the graph; others mark threshold combinations of densities past which sudden shifts in behavior should occur. A technique for determining whether isolegs exist is described and applied to hummingbird data. These data were collected experimentally in the field expressly to test one isoleg model. All three species of hummingbird exhibited at least one of the sudden-shift type of isoleg. Their behaviors map onto the density graph in the predicted portions of the graph with only one exception. The data also support the prediction that behavior in the field is disjunct, i.e. subject to substantial, abrupt, discontinuous changes produced by very small continuous changes in a control variable. Some evidence for continuous control was also found, but it is ambiguous. Theory predicts that the two forms of control should be found together in some optimal systems.},

  abstract = {Wildfires are a key driver of boreal forest structure and community composition that alter food resources affecting the behaviour and ecology of wildlife. In the first 50~years post-wildfire, woody browse availability in upland forests increase in quantity and quality for generalist ungulates, such as moose (Alces alces) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Greater favorable habitat for these generalist ungulates results in increases to their respective populations, and through apparent competition, leads to increases in wolf populations; thus, causing unsustainable levels of predation on threatened woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) populations. However, the duration of post-wildfire browse availability is not well understood in the Boreal Plains of Alberta as previous studies are primarily from the Taiga and Boreal Shield where vegetation communities are structurally different. This study examines the changes in winter browse richness, evenness, abundance, and community composition, as well as their use (browse levels) by moose and white-tailed deer, over a 150-year post-wildfire period. In the summer of 2019, we collected vegetation and ungulate browsing data from 164 upland and lowland forest sites in northeastern Alberta, Canada. We used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and ordinal logistic regression to examine changes in browse measures. Species richness and evenness showed a double peak at 10{\textendash}25~years and 90~years post-wildfire in mixedwood forests, as a result of fluctuations in browse palatability, while browse abundance was constant. In contrast, black spruce and lowland forests had similar species richness, evenness and abundance over the 150-year chronosequence. However, browse abundance in lowland forests was higher than mixedwood forests, but this consisted of low palatable browse. Browsing was significant in jack pine forests, mixedwood forests and poor fens; coniferous saplings were generally avoided, whereas 35{\textendash}65\% of available deciduous saplings were browsed. Understanding post-wildfire succession and ungulate browsing in post-wildfire forests provides useful information for managing alternative prey populations necessary for long-term woodland caribou conservation.},

In the study area with lowest food availability, the moose foraged almost exclusively on birch (Betula pubescens) of poor quality (expressed as digestibility). In the other study area with higher food availability, a much more diversified species composition of the diet was found, including several Salix spp., rowan (Sorbus aucuparia), aspen (Populus tremula), and bird cherry (Prunus padus). Large differences in the daily activity of moose were found between the study areas. In the poor food availability area, moose browsed twigs of poor quality and were inactive a greater proportion of the time. They used a smaller area for foraging, but removed a much larger fraction of the available biomass from each browsing site than in the higher food quality study area. No significant difference was found between the study areas in the gross daily dry matter intake rate. A larger amount of feces was defecated in the low quality study area, resulting in a significantly higher net intake of digestible dry matter in the area with high food quality. Thus, because of digestive constraints, the quality of the forage determined the rate of energy gain from foraging. The interaction between moose and their food is therefore strongly dependent on factors that influence the digestibility of forage.},

Given a mathematical or computational model y=f(x1,x2,{\dots},xk), where the input factors xi's are uncorrelated with one another, one can see y as the realization of a stochastic process obtained by sampling each of the xi from its marginal distribution. The sensitivity indices are related to the decomposition of the variance of y into terms either due to each xi taken singularly (first order indices), as well as into terms due to the cooperative effects of more than one xi. In this paper we assume that one has computed the full set of first order sensitivity indices as well as the full set of total-order sensitivity indices (a~fairly common strategy in sensitivity analysis), and show that in this case the same set of model evaluations can be used to compute double estimates of: \&\#x02022;the total effect of two factors taken together, for all such k2 couples, where k is the dimensionality of the model;\&\#x02022;the total effect of k-2 factors taken together, for all k2 such (k-2) ples. We further introduce a new strategy for the computation of the full sets of first plus total order sensitivity indices that is about 50\% cheaper in terms of model evaluations with respect to previously published works. We discuss separately the case where the input factors xi's are not independent from each other.},

We evaluated wolf (Canis lupus) prey selection at two different spatial scales, i.e., inter- and intra-territorial, using data from 409 ungulate wolf-kills in an expanding wolf population in Scandinavia. This expansion includes a change from a one-prey into a two-prey system with variable densities of one large-sized ungulate; moose (Alces alces) and one small-sized ungulate; roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). Among wolf territories, the proportion of roe deer in wolf kills was related to both pack size and roe deer density, but not to moose density. Pairs of wolves killed a higher proportion of roe deer than did packs, and wolves switched to kill more roe deer as their density increased above a 1:1 ratio in relation to the availability of the two species. At the intra-territorial level, wolves again responded to changes in roe deer density in their prey selection whereas we found no effect of snow depth, time during winter, or other predator-related factors on the wolves' choice to kill moose or roe deer. Moose population density was only weakly related to intra-territorial prey selection. Our results show that the functional response of wolves on moose, the species hitherto considered as the main prey, was strongly dependent on the density of a smaller, alternative, ungulate prey. The impact of wolf predation on the prey species community is therefore likely to change with the composition of the multi-prey species community along with the geographical expansion of the wolf population.},

The population of prey is divided into two subpopulations, adult prey and immature. The ratio of intrinsic growth of predator population density divided by adult prey conversion factors into a predator. Reduction of predator populations has a reciprocal relationship with the availability of favorite foods determined by the environmental resources. We also consider that Holling type II the functional response for the predator. We have investigated the local stability and the solution of the system. We have studied the existence and feasibility of various equilibrium points. The system has three positive equilibria, namely the original, the extinction of the predator and the interior point. We explore the stabilities of all nonnegative equilibrium point by the real parts of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix at each equilibrium point must be negative. We also use the Routh-Hurwitz criterion to investigate the stability at the interior equilibrium point. This study aims to detect the limit cycle with its phase portrait and its time-series graphs of the prey-predator system. Numerical simulated are represented as phase portraits to draw the stability of the equilibrium point. In our Numerical outcomes confirmed the analytical results and the local behavior prey-predator model which start from their positive initial condition. The parameter value is taken mainly from the literature and assumption. By a computational Python using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, we solved the prey-predator system and showed some new phase portraits such as the existence of the stable or unstable equilibrium point under a suitable value of the parameter. The next research, we will explore the global stability analysis behavior of the interior equilibrium point.},

Much of this research has addressed the consequences of warming for phenological and distributional shifts. In contrast, relatively little is known about the physiological responses of plants and insect pollinators to climate warming and, in particular, how these responses might affect plant-pollinator interactions. Here, we summarize the direct physiological effects of temperature on flowering plants and pollinating insects to highlight ways in which plant and pollinator responses could affect floral resources for pollinators, and pollination success for plants, respectively. We also consider the overall effects of these responses on plant-pollinator interaction networks. Plant responses to warming, which include altered flower, nectar, and pollen production, could modify floral resource availability and reproductive output of pollinating insects. Similarly, pollinator responses, such as altered foraging activity, body size, and life span, could affect patterns of pollen flow and pollination success of flowering plants. As a result, network structure could be altered as interactions are gained and lost, weakened and strengthened, even without the gain or loss of species or temporal overlap. Future research that addresses not only how plant and pollinator physiology are affected by warming but also how responses scale up to affect interactions and networks should allow us to better understand and predict the effects of climate change on this important ecosystem service},

Scop. and is considered as a biological control agent against this weed. In order to investigate if augmented densities of this species could be sustained, predation on C. rubiginosa larvae was studied in the field with the aid of continuous video surveillance of individual prey during three seasons at two different study sites. 2 The paper wasp Polistes dominulus Christ (Hymenoptera, Vespidae) was responsible for 99{$\cdot$}4\% predation on C. rubiginosa larvae at both study sites. Prey densities were always reduced to a few individuals at the sites after a few days only. Thus, P. dominulus may annihilate the effect of augmentative releases of the beetle as a biocontrol agent. 3 P. dominulus showed no aggregation in patches of high host density (numerical response). The observed density dependence was attributed to the functional response of the wasp. 4 P. dominulus showed a Type III functional response. In mark-and-recapture experiments we found no indication that this type of functional response was the result of single wasps specializing on this particular prey type. 5 Type III functional responses in generalists can result by switching to prey species which become temporarily abundant. Since in a natural setting a mixture of prey species coexists in different abundance and which are differentially accepted by generalist predators, it is imperative to study their functional response in the field.},

If food web impacts on productivity vary with plant diversity, as predicted by both theoretical and empirical studies, estimates of the effect of plant diversity on productivity may be biased. We experimentally removed arthropods, foliar fungi and soil fungi from the longest-running plant diversity experiment. We found that fungi and arthropods removed a constant, large proportion of biomass leading to a greater reduction of total biomass in high diversity plots. As a result, the effect of diversity on measured plant productivity was much higher in the absence of fungi and arthropods. Thus, diversity increases productivity more than reported in previous studies that did not control for the effects of heterotrophic consumption.},

During 2000-2007, we compared proportional removal (ratio of browse consumption to browse production) in eight areas of Interior Alaska, USA, with multi-year twinning rates of the respective moose populations. Several prior studies concluded that twinning rate provided an index of the nutritional condition of moose. We theorized that a plant-based sampling of proportional use of browse by moose in late winter would inversely correlate with the nutritional condition of moose. We sampled willow Salix spp., quaking aspen Populus tremuloides, balsam poplar P. balsamifera and Alaska paper birch Betula neoalaskana, i.e. plants with current annual growth (CAG) between 0.5 and 3.0 m above ground. We estimated the biomass of CAG and biomass removed by moose based on bite diameters and diameter-mass regressions specific to each browse species. Mean browse removal by moose varied among study areas from 9 to 43\% of CAG. Moose twinning rate (range: 7-64\%) was inversely correlated with proportional browse removal by moose (Spearman's rho = -0.863, P {$<$} 0.005). Proportional browse removal appeared useful in linking foraging ecology and population dynamics of moose in Alaska, and the technique may be used to quantify resource limitation in moose populations inhabiting boreal forest in a broader geographic region.},

Differences in predator-avoidance strategies largely explain the major differences in caribou densities that occur naturally in North America.

Non-migratory caribou that live in areas where wolf populations are sustained by alternate prey can be eliminated by wolf predation.},

To investigate these impacts, we have developed a spatially explicit, agent-based model (ABM) to simulate winter habitat selection and use of woodland caribou, and to determine the relative impacts of different industrial features on caribou habitat-selection strategies. The ABM model is composed of cognitive caribou agents possessing memory and decision-making heuristics that act to optimize tradeoffs between energy acquisition and disturbance. A set of environmental data layers was used to develop a virtual grid representing the landscape over which caribou move. This grid contained forage-availability, energy-content, and predation-risk values. The model was calibrated using GPS data from caribou radio collars (n = 13) deployed over six months from 2004 to 2005, representing caribou winter activities. Additional simulations were conducted on caribou habitat-selection strategies by assigning industrial features (i.e., roads, seismic lines, pipelines, well sites, cutblocks and burns) different levels of disturbance depending on their type, age, and density. Differences in disturbance effects between industry features were confirmed by verifying which resultant simulations of caribou movement patterns most closely match actual caribou distributions and other patterns extracted from the GPS data. The results elucidate the degree to which caribou perceive different industry features as disturbance, and the differential energetic costs associated with each, thus offering insight into why caribou are choosing the habitats they use, and consequently, the level and type of industry most likely to affect their bioenergetics and fitness.},

We used predator-prey theory to predict outcomes of ecosystem experiments aimed at mitigating apparent competition by reducing primary prey. Simulations predicted declines in secondary prey following reductions in primary prey because predators consumed more secondary prey until predator numbers responded to reduced prey densities. Losses were exacerbated by a higher carrying capacity of primary prey and a longer lag time of the predator's numerical response, but a gradual reduction in primary prey was less detrimental to the secondary prey. We compared predictions against two field experiments where endangered woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) were victims of apparent competition. First, when deer (Odocoileus sp.) declined suddenly following a severe winter, cougar (Puma concolor) declined with a 1{\textendash}2-year lag, yet in the interim more caribou were killed by cougars, and caribou populations declined by 40\%. Second, when moose (Alces alces) were gradually reduced using a management experiment, wolf (Canis lupus) populations declined but did not shift consumption to caribou, and the largest caribou subpopulation stabilized. The observed contrasting outcomes of sudden versus gradual declines in primary prey supported theoretical predictions. Combining theory with field studies clarified how to manage communities to mitigate endangerment caused by apparent competition that affects many taxa.},

  abstract = {Apparent competition has been shown to play a key role in population declines of woodland caribou. The mechanism is based on the process of increased human footprint leading to increased moose and deer numbers, greater predator populations and subsequently higher predation rates on caribou. Yet, apparent competition among moose, deer and caribou is undoubtedly influenced by other factors such as climate change, fire, weather patterns, and may vary with natural landscape attributes (e.g., land cover type) that also affect ungulate abundance and distribution. To explicitly evaluate how spatial factors influence apparent competition, we initiated a project to examine how population growth rates of caribou relate to landscape attributes (e.g., degree of human disturbance; proportion of uplands versus wetlands), ungulate abundance, and wolf abundance. To accomplish this, we surveyed 6 large areas (4000-5000 km2) to estimate wolf density in landscapes that varied from almost no human footprint in the Northwest Territories (NWT), to intensive footprint in Alberta and British Columbia (BC). Pre-existing sources of information about the sampling areas included knowledge of moose density, caribou population growth rates ({$\lambda$}), and GIS mapping layers representing human footprint and land-cover type. Wolf densities ranged from 1.6/1000 km2 in NWT to 15.6/1000 km2 in northeast BC. With only 6 data points, results are necessarily preliminary, but we found an inverse relationship between wolf density and caribou {$\lambda$}. We also found that human footprint positively affected wolf density and negatively affected caribou {$\lambda$}. Land cover type (wetlands) negatively affected caribou {$\lambda$}. Even though data are very limited, our sampling design captured high variation in wolf densities, human footprint and land cover, which will facilitate future analyses once additional data are collected. By directly relating spatial factors to population parameters (e.g., growth rates and abundances), our approach provides an explicit assessment of the apparent competition hypothesis, the prevailing paradigm for explaining widespread declines of woodland caribou.},

  abstract = {The expansion of moose into southern British Columbia caused the decline and extirpation of woodland caribou due to their shared predators, a process commonly referred to as apparent competition. Using an adaptive management experiment, we tested the hypothesis that reducing moose to historic levels would reduce apparent competition and therefor recover caribou populations. Nested within this broad hypothesis were three specific hypotheses: (1) sport hunting could be used to substantially reduce moose numbers to an ecological target; (2) wolves in this ecosystem were primarily limited by moose abundance; and (3) caribou were limited by wolf predation. These hypotheses were evaluated with a before-after control-impact (BACI) design that included response metrics such as population trends and vital rates of caribou, moose, and wolves. Three caribou subpopulations were subject to the moose reduction treatment and two were in a reference area where moose were not reduced. When the moose harvest was increased, the moose population declined substantially in the treatment area (by 70\%) but not the reference area, suggesting that the policy had the desired effect and was not caused by a broader climatic process. Wolf numbers subsequently declined in the treatment area, with wolf dispersal rates 2.5{\texttimes} greater, meaning that dispersal was the likely mechanism behind the wolf numerical response, though reduced recruitment and starvation was also documented in the treatment area. Caribou adult survival increased from 0.78 to 0.88 in the treatment area, but declined in the reference. Caribou recruitment was unaffected by the treatment. The largest caribou subpopulation stabilized in the treatment area, but declined in the reference area. The observed population stability is comparable to other studies that used intensive wolf control, but is insufficient to achieve recovery, suggesting that multiple limiting factors and corresponding management tools must be addressed simultaneously to achieve population growth.},

  abstract = {Predator-prey dynamics are increasingly being modified by the alteration of natural habitats. Such alteration has led to increased predation rates and local extirpation of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in western Canada. Linear features such as roads or seismic lines (narrow corridors used for petroleum exploration that are cleared of vegetation) increase predation rates on caribou by increasing wolf (Canis lupus) movement rates and by facilitating access into caribou habitat. Linear feature restoration is therefore hypothesised to help reverse caribou declines. However, with the high financial cost to restore approximately 350,000 km of seismic lines within western Canada's boreal forests, theoretical predictions can clarify the efficacy of such actions. We use a mathematical model based on coupled ordinary differential equations representing predator-prey dynamics to estimate equilibrium densities of caribou, moose (Alces alces) and wolves under various parameter scenarios. Changes in equilibrium density serve as a proxy for the expected effect of linear feature restoration on population densities. Our model captures dynamical feedbacks between caribou and wolf densities, and also includes moose, which are the wolf's primary prey species. With our best estimates of parameter values, caribou density increased 2.51-fold if all linear features were restored and 1.61-fold if only seismic lines were restored. As a comparison, simulated predator reductions increased caribou densities 3.92-fold, nearly twice the total response of linear feature restoration. The effect of restoration was increased if caribou group size was smaller, yet was less pronounced if carrying capacity for ungulates was higher. By varying the parameter values and fixing population densities, our approach allowed us to partition the caribou populations' response from restoration into the contributions of the various mechanisms and feedbacks. In particular, contrasting simulation results where wolf densities are kept fixed with those where they are free to respond to prey allowed us to disentangle the relative importance of wolf functional and numerical response. This novel approach indicates that most of the increase in caribou densities after restoration was due to reduced foraging efficiency of wolves, especially reduced habitat overlap. Overall, our results suggest that restoration could substantially benefit caribou populations, but only if all linear features are restored, which is far from realistic. Linear feature restoration alone may not lead to population recovery, and should therefore be coupled with other direct management actions to successfully recover caribou.},

  abstract = {Changes in primary productivity have the potential to substantially alter food webs, with positive outcomes for some species and negative outcomes for others. Understanding the environmental context and species traits that give rise to these divergent outcomes is a major challenge to the generality of both theoretical and applied ecology. In aquatic systems, nutrient-mediated eutrophication has led to major declines in species diversity, motivating us to seek terrestrial analogues using a large-mammal system across 598 000 km2 of the Canadian boreal forest. These forests are undergoing some of the most rapid rates of land-use change on Earth and are home to declining caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) populations. Using satellite-derived estimates of primary productivity, coupled with estimates of moose (Alces alces) and wolf (Canis lupus) abundance, we used path analyses to discriminate among hypotheses explaining how habitat alteration can affect caribou population growth. Hypotheses included food limitation, resource dominance by moose over caribou, and apparent competition with predators shared between moose and caribou. Results support apparent competition and yield estimates of wolf densities (1.8 individuals 1000 km-2) above which caribou populations decline. Our multi-trophic analysis provides insight into the cascading effects of habitat alteration from forest cutting that destabilize terrestrial predator-prey dynamics. Finally, the path analysis highlights why conservation actions directed at the proximate cause of caribou decline have been more successful in the near term than those directed further along the trophic chain.},

Yet, their effects have not been widely understood, especially in multispecies systems. That is, it remains unclear whether the perceived benefits of adding functional responses are simply mathematical artefacts or not. For example, while functional responses have been useful to model the dynamics of 2-species systems, still some functional responses have been criticized for producing unrealistic results. Moreover, it has been unclear the extent to which adding functional responses in multispecies systems can allow the dynamics to reach any type of behavior, contrary to the limits that nature may impose. Thus, it is necessary to fully understand the effect of functional responses on ecological models as it is directly linked to their explanatory power of ecological dynamics.},

Therefore, it is critical to analyze the influence of climate change on possible distribution of M. punicea for conservation and sustainable utilization of this species. In this study, we used MaxEnt ecological niche modeling to predict the potential distribution of M. punicea under current and future climate scenarios in the southeastern margin region of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Model projections under current climate show that 16.8\% of the study area is suitable habitat for Meconopsis. However, future projections indicate a sharp decline in potential habitat for 2050 and 2070 climate change scenarios. Soil type was the most important environmental variable in determining the habitat suitability of M. punicea, with 27.75\% contribution to model output. Temperature seasonality (16.41\%), precipitation of warmest quarter (14.01\%), and precipitation of wettest month (13.02\%), precipitation seasonality (9.41\%) and annual temperature range (9.24\%) also made significant contributions to model output. The mean elevation of suitable habitat for distribution of M. punicea is also likely to shift upward in most future climate change scenarios. This study provides vital information for the protection and sustainable use of medicinal species like M. punicea in the context of global environmental change. Our findings can aid in developing rational, broad-scale adaptation strategies for conservation and management for ecosystem services, in light of future climate changes.},

  abstract = {The rate of food intake exerts an important influence on many aspects of herbivore ecology, including diet and habitat choices, social organization, and predator avoidance. When food is spatially concentrated, short-term dry matter intake rate (I, g/min) is determined largely by morphology of the mouth and mechanics of food consumption. Morphology (tooth size and jaw musculature) and mechanics (cropping and chewing processes) are hypothesized to scale with body mass (M) for mammalian herbivores. By using a simple model of processes regulating short-term I, we developed and tested hypotheses on the scaling of these parameters in 12 species of mammalian herbivores whose masses ranged from 0.05 kg to 547 kg. Specifically, this model predicts that I is controlled by the size of bite taken, by the time required to crop a bite, and by the rate at which food in the mouth can be processed. Maximum bite size scaled with M0 72, whereas cropping time did not scale with body mass and averaged 0.015 min/bite across species. Food processing in the mouth scaled with M0 70. We concluded that the maximum intake rate of mammalian herbivores will scale closely with M0 71. This conclusion was corroborated by 39 published observations of the maximum I of mammalian herbivores. Thus, the scaling of I coincides closely with the scaling of daily energy requirements.},

  abstract = {For more than half a century, biologists have intensively studied food habits and foraging behavior of moose (Alces alces) across their circumpolar range. This focus stems, in part, from the economic, recreational, and ecosystem values of moose, and because they are relatively easy to observe. As a result of this research effort and the relatively simple and intact ecosystems in which they often reside, moose have emerged as a model herbivore through which many key ecological questions have been examined. First, dietary specialization has traditionally been defined solely based on a narrow, realized diet (e.g., obtaining {$>$}60\% of its diet from 1 plant genus). This definition has not been particularly useful in understanding herbivore adaptations because {$>$}99\% of mammalian herbivores are thus classified as generalists. Although moose consume a variety of browses across their range, many populations consume 50-99\% of their diets from 1 genus (e.g., Salix). Like obligatory herbivores, moose have demonstrated adaptations to the chemistry and morphology of their nearly monospecific diets, which precludes them from eating large amounts of grass and many forbs. New classifications for dietary niche suggest that moose fit on the continuum between facultative specialists and facultative generalists. Second, moose have been the subject of early and influential models predicting foraging behavior based on the tradeoffs between quality and quantity in plants. Subsequent models have predicted the size of stems selected by moose based on the tradeoffs between fast harvesting (large twigs) and quick digestion (small twigs). Because of their size, moose require many hours to harvest food, often selecting large bites as browse density declines. Finally, long-term monitoring of moose populations has provided evidence of how populations and communities are regulated. Low reproductive rates and long-term population trends shaped by moose density and forage availability on Isle Royale suggest a strong bottom-up effect on moose populations. Empirical data and simulation models suggest that moose may shape their own forage supply, influencing their community and their own populations, especially when large predators are scarce. Likewise, predation is the primary factor affecting calf survival and thus moose populations in Alaska, demonstrating the important role of top-down factors. Moose will continue to provide a model for examining ecological questions such as tolerances for plant chemistry, what governs animal movements over landscapes, and reciprocal interactions between predation and reproduction.},

We explored a potential conflict between the preservation of threatened free-ranging plains bison Bison bison bison and the conservation in a National Park of a rare plant community {\textendash} native rough fescue Festuca hallii grasslands. We investigated the dispersal of exotic seeds by examining 283 samples of bison faeces and the spatial distribution of exotic plant species in relation to bison behaviour. We showed that bison facilitated the long-distance dispersal of exotic plant species into the park by transporting seeds. Our analysis indicated there was a high probability ({$>$}75\%) of occurrence of clover Trifolium spp. and timothy Phleum pratense on bison trails across 38\% and 27\%, respectively, of fescue grassland area. There was also a high probability of occurrence of timothy on bison wallows across 20\% of fescue grasslands area. Furthermore, we demonstrated that exotic plant species were most likely to occur within 3 km of potential introduction points, and identified specific grassland patches most at risk of exotic plant species introduction by bison. By revealing the ecological mechanism underlying the emergence of a potential conflict, we were able to delineate spatial variation in the relative threat that bison might pose to the integrity of native fescue plant communities, allowing managers to optimize the allocation of conservation effort. Our study highlights the value of understanding the ecological mechanisms driving conflict between conservation programmes in order to set evidence-based priorities for guiding future conservation decision-making.

  abstract = {In parts of the world such as the Pacific Islands, Australia, and New Zealand, introduced vertebrate predators have caused the demise of indigenous mammal and bird species. A number of releases for reestablishment of these mammal species in mainland Australia have failed because predators extirpated the new populations. The nature of the decline of both extant populations and reintroduced colonies provides information on the dynamics of predation. Predator-prey theory suggests that the effects of predation are usually inversely dependent on density (depensatory) when the prey are not the primary food supply of exotic predators. Thus, such predators can cause extinction of endemic prey species. Three types of evidence can be deduced from the predator-prey interactions that allow predictions for conservation: (1) whether per capita rates of change for prey increase or decrease with declining prey densities, (2) whether predation is depensatory or density-dependent, and (3) the overall magnitude of predation. If this magnitude is too high for coexistence, then the degree of predator removal required can be predicted. If the magnitude of predation is sufficiently low, then the threshold density of prey that management must achieve to allow predator and prey to coexist can also be predicted. We analyzed published reports of both declining populations and reintroduced colonies of endangered marsupial populations in Australia. The observed predation curves conformed to the predictions of predator-prey theory. Some, such as the black-footed rock-wallaby (Petrogale lateralis), were classic alternate prey and were vulnerable below a threshold population size. Others, such as the brush-tailed bettong (Bettongia penicillata), have a refuge at low numbers and thus offer the best chance for reintroduction. Our predictions suggest a protocol for an experimental management program for the conservation of sensitive prey species: (1) determination of net rates of change of prey with declining population, (2) improvement of survivorship through habitat manipulation, (3) improvement of survivorship through predator removal, (4) determination of the threshold density above which reintroductions can succeed, and (5) manipulations to change interactions from Type II to Type III. The task in the future is to determine how to change the vulnerability of the prey so that they can have a refuge at low numbers. Predicci{\'o}n de los Efectos de la Depredaci{\'o}n en la Conservaci{\'o}n de una Presa en Peligro de Extinci{\'o}n En algunas partes del mundo como son las Islas del Pac{\'i}fico, Australia y Nueva Zelandia, los veretebrados depredadores introducidos han ocasionado la desaparici{\'o}n de especies ind{\'i}genas de mam{\'i}feros y aves. Un gran n{\'u}mero de liberaciones para el restablecimiento de estas especies de mam{\'i}feros en tierras continentales de Australia han fracasado debido a que los depredadores han extirpado las poblaciones nuevas. La naturaleza de la declinaci{\'o}n tanto de las poblaciones existentes como de las colonias reintroducidas provee informaci{\'o}n de las din{\'a}micas de la depredaci{\'o}n. La teor{\'i}a sobre depredador-presa sugiere que los efectos de la depredaci{\'o}n son usualmente inversamente densodependientes (depensatorios) cuando las presas no son el alimento principal de los depredadores ex{\'o}ticos. Por lo tanto, estos depredadores pueden causar la extinci{\'o}n de especies de presas end{\'e}micas. Existen tres tipos de evidencia que pueden ser deducidas de las interacciones depredador-presa y que permiten predicciones para la conservaci{\'o}n: 1) que las tasas de cambio per c{\'a}pita de presas incremente o disminuya con la declinaci{\'o}n de las densidades de presas, 2) que la depredaci{\'o}n sea depensatoria o densodependiente, y 3) la magnitude total de la depredaci{\'o}n. Si la magnitud es muy alta para la coexistencia, entonces el grado de remoci{\'o}n del depredador requerido puede ser predecido. Si la magnitud de la depredaci{\'o}n es suficientemente baja, entonces la densidad umbral de la presa que debe ser alcanzado mediante manejo y que permita al depredador y la presa coexistir tambien puede ser predecido. Analizamos reportes publicados tanto de declinaciones de poblaciones como de colonias reintroducidas de poblaciones de marsupiales en peligro de extinci{\'o}n en Australia. Las curvas de depredaci{\'o}n observadas se conformaron a la teor{\'i}a de depredador-presa.

Verbal models, however, can be interpreted in different ways leading to confusion. Therefore, we predict from first principles the range of possible trophic level interactions, and define mathematically the instantaneous effects of experimental perturbations. Some of these interactions are logically and biologically unfeasible. The remaining set of 27 feasible models is based on an initial assumption, for simplicity, of linear interactions between trophic levels. Many more complex and non-linear models are logically feasible but, for parsimony, simple ones are tested first. We use an experiment in the boreal forest of Canada to test predictions of instantaneous changes to trophic levels and distinguish between competing models. Seven different perturbations systematically removed each trophic level or, for some levels, supplemented them. The predictions resulting from the perturbations were concerned with the direction of change in biomass in the other levels. The direct effects of each perturbation produced strong top-down and bottom-up changes in biomass. At both the vegetation and herbivore levels top-down was stronger than bottom-up despite some compensatory growth stimulated by herbivory. The combination of experiments produced results consistent with two-way (reciprocal) interactions at each level. Indirect effects on one or two levels removed from the perturbation were either very weak or undetectable. Top-down effects were strong when direct but attenuated quickly. Bottom-up effects were less strong but persisted as indirect effects to higher levels. Although the `pure reciprocal' model best fits our results for the boreal forest system different models may apply to different ecosystems around the world.},

During the winter period, spruce provided ten times more biomass for herbivores than beech. However, beech provided more metabolizable energy, 7.38 MJ/kg on average, whereas spruce only provided 6.57 MJ/kg. From the point of view of ``risk of damage by herbivores'', artificial regeneration suffered the worst damage after using the Clear Cutting method of forest regeneration, as there was the least amount of biomass available, and thus, herbivores caused the greatest damage. On average, 12\% of shoots were damaged in clearings. Most at risk was young forest vegetation up to 1 m tall. In summer, the area was overgrown with available plants, but in winter, the herbivores focused mainly on eating woody shoots. Damage to the natural regeneration when using the Shelterwood Cutting and Strip Cutting regeneration methods ranged up to 3\%. At the same time, a high amount of available biomass was measured there, most likely due to its frequent natural regeneration. Thus, both types of trees regenerated in this way were not as susceptible to damage by herbivores as when regenerated using the Clear Cutting method.},

Also, we show that the spatially homogeneous and nonhomogeneous periodic patterns may switch for different bifurcation parameter values. Moreover, a double Hopf bifurcation occurs at the intersection point of the homogeneous and nonhomogeneous Hopf bifurcation curves, and spatially nonhomogeneous quasi-periodic patterns can be observed via numerical simulations near the double Hopf bifurcation point.

  abstract = {In Canada, boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) are declining in numbers, in part due to increased predation by wolves (Canis lupus). One management option to reduce wolf{\textendash}caribou interactions and thus protect caribou is to remove man-made linear features (LFs), structures such as roads, trails, and cut lines, which are used by wolves as traveling paths. Linear features increase wolf traveling speed and could additionally facilitate wolf entry into caribou habitat. Our goal was to quantify the expected effect of LF removal on caribou mortality and investigate whether this LF restoration could be a sufficient measure to stop caribou declines. We simulated the effects of LF restoration on caribou adult and calf survival in spatially explicit wolf{\textendash}caribou encounter models. The models were parameterized using Global Positioning System (GPS) data, hidden Markov models (HMMs), and information from the published literature. Complete LF restoration decreased wolf traveling speed and thus reduced caribou mortality. The proportional reduction in adult caribou mortality ranged from 10 to 25\% of its original value, and the proportional reduction in calf mortality ranged from 8 to 23\%, depending on caribou density, number of wolf packs, kill probability given an encounter, and detection distance of wolves for caribou. Building on the model output, we used empirical caribou data to calculate the effects of reduced mortalities on the finite rate of annual population change, {$\lambda$}. Assuming that 25\% or less of calf mortality was wolf-related, {$\lambda$} stayed below one, that is, populations kept declining, even with complete LF restoration. With 50\% of calf mortality due to wolves, caribou populations stopped declining ({$\lambda\geq$}1) if adult and calf mortality were reduced by at least 19 to 24\%. However, these values were not achieved in a majority of the parameter combinations in our study, not even with complete LF restoration. Given that LF restoration as a single measure is unlikely to stop boreal caribou populations from declining, we used a case example to illustrate how LF restoration could make a small contribution in a portfolio of short-term and long-term management options to reduce wolf predation on caribou.},

While studies on young trees have demonstrated that fire intensity is a determinant of post-fire net primary productivity, wildland fires on landscape to regional scales have largely been assumed to either cause tree mortality, or conversely, cause no physiological impact, ignoring the impacted but surviving trees. Our objective was to understand how fire intensity affects post-fire net primary productivity in conifer-dominated forested ecosystems on the spatial scale of large wildland fires. We examined the relationships between fire radiative power (FRP), its temporal integral (fire radiative energy {\textendash} FRE), and net primary productivity (NPP) using 16 years of data from the MOderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) for 15 large fires in western United States coniferous forests. The greatest NPP post-fire loss occurred 1 year post-fire and ranged from -67 to -312 g C m\textsuperscript{-2} yr\textsuperscript{-1} (-13 to -54 \%) across all fires. Forests dominated by fire-resistant species (species that typically survive low-intensity fires) experienced the lowest relative NPP reductions compared to forests with less resistant species. Post-fire NPP in forests that were dominated by fire-susceptible species were not as sensitive to FRP or FRE, indicating that NPP in these forests may be reduced to similar levels regardless of fire intensity. Conversely, post-fire NPP in forests dominated by fire-resistant and mixed species decreased with increasing FRP or FRE. In some cases, this dose{\textendash}response relationship persisted for more than a decade post-fire, highlighting a legacy effect of fire intensity on post-fire C dynamics in these forests.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Boreal caribou were extirpated from the Charlevoix region (Qu\&eacute;bec) in the 1920s because of hunting and poaching. In 1965, the Qu\&eacute;bec government initiated a caribou reintroduction program in Charlevoix. During the winters of 1966 and 1967, a total of 48 boreal caribou were captured, translocated by plane, and released within enclosures; only their offspring (82 individuals) were released in the wild. Between 1967 and 1980, a wolf control program was applied to support caribou population growth. The caribou population, however, remained relatively stable at 45\&ndash;55 individuals during this period. During the 1980s, the population grew slowly at a rate of approximately 5\% each year to reach a peak of 126 individuals in 1992. At that time, Bergerud \&amp; Mercer (1989) reported that the Charlevoix experiment was the only successful attempt at caribou reintroduction in the presence of predators (in North America). Afterwards, the population declined and since then it has been relatively stable at about 80 individuals. Here we reviewed the literature regarding the ecology and population dynamics of the Charlevoix caribou herd since its reintroduction, in an attempt to critically assess the value of reintroduction as a conservation tool for this species. Indeed, the Charlevoix caribou herd is now considered at very high risk of extinction mostly because of its small size, its isolation from other caribou populations, and low recruitment. The Charlevoix region has been heavily impacted by forestry activities since the early 1980s. Recent studies have indicated that these habitat modifications may have benefited populations of wolves and black bears\&mdash;two predators of caribou\&mdash;and that caribou range fidelity may have exposed caribou to higher predation risk via maladaptive habitat selection. As females are ageing, and females and calves suffer high predation pressure from wolves and bears respectively, we suggest that the future of this reintroduced herd is in question and that they are facing a high probability of extinction in the near future if further action is not taken.},

These predictions are borne out in comprehensive data across African savanna parks: Mixed feeders are the most abundant herbivores in Africa, alongside a few migratory grazer populations. Overall, clear mixed-feeder dominance may reflect a historical pattern or may instead mirror a general global decline in specialists. Regardless, mixed feeders dominate the savannas of the present and future.},

They explain the rationale for applying optimality models to the strategies and mechanics of foraging and present the basic "average-rate maximizing" models and their extensions. The work discusses new directions in foraging research: incorporating incomplete information and risk-sensitive behavior in foraging models; analyzing trade-offs, such as nutrient requirements and the threat of being eaten while foraging; formulating dynamic models; and building constrained optimization models that assume that foragers can use only simple "rules of thumb." As an analysis of these and earlier research developments and as a contribution to debates about the role of theory in evolutionary biology. Foraging Theory will appeal to a wide range of readers, from students to research professionals, in behavioral ecology, population and community ecology, animal behavior, and animal psychology, and especially to those planning empirical tests of foraging models.},

In this paper we give an overview of a Bayesian inference framework, developed over the last 10 years, which, using spatial data, offers a general formalism within which ecological interactions may be characterised and quantified. Interactions are identified through deviations of the spatial distribution of co-occurrences of spatial variables relative to a benchmark for the non-interacting system and based on a statistical ensemble of spatial cells. The formalism allows for the integration of both biotic and abiotic factors of arbitrary resolution. We concentrate on the conceptual and mathematical underpinnings of the formalism, showing how, using the Naive Bayes approximation, it can be used to not only compare and contrast the relative contribution from each variable, but also to construct species distributions and niches based on arbitrary variable type. We show how the formalism can be used to quantify confounding and therefore help disentangle the complex causal chains that are present in ecosystems. We also show species distributions and their associated niches can be used to infer standard ``micro'' ecological interactions, such as predation and parasitism. We present several representative use cases that validate our framework, both in terms of being consistent with present knowledge of a set of known interactions, as well as making and validating predictions about new, previously unknown interactions in the case of zoonoses.},

  abstract = {Thoughtful leaders increasingly recognize that we are not only failing to solve the persistent problems we face, but are in fact causing them. System dynamics is designed to help avoid such policy resistance and identify high-leverage policies for sustained improvement. What does it take to be an effective systems thinker, and to teach system dynamics fruitfully? Understanding complex systems requires mastery of concepts such as feedback, stocks and flows, time delays, and nonlinearity. Research shows that these concepts are highly counterintuitive and poorly understood. It also shows how they can be taught and learned. Doing so requires the use of formal models and simulations to test our mental models and develop our intuition about complex systems. Yet, though essential, these concepts and tools are not sufficient. Becoming an effective systems thinker also requires the rigorous and disciplined use of scientific inquiry skills so that we can uncover our hidden assumptions and biases. It requires respect and empathy for others and other viewpoints. Most important, and most difficult to learn, systems thinking requires understanding that all models are wrong and humility about the limitations of our knowledge. Such humility is essential in creating an environment in which we can learn about the complex systems in which we are embedded and work effectively to create the world we truly desire.

  abstract = {Progressive anthropogenic disturbance can alter ecosystem organization potentially causing shifts from one stable state to another. This potential for ecosystem shifts must be considered when establishing targets and objectives for conservation. We ask whether a predator{\textendash}prey system response to incremental anthropogenic disturbance might shift along a disturbance gradient and, if it does, whether any disturbance thresholds are evident for this system. Development of linear corridors in forested areas increases wolf predation effectiveness, while high density of development provides a safe-haven for their prey. If wolves limit moose population growth, then wolves and moose should respond inversely to land cover disturbance. Using general linear model analysis, we test how the rate of change in moose (Alces alces) density and wolf (Canis lupus) harvest density are influenced by the rate of change in land cover and proportion of land cover disturbed within a 300,000~km2 area in the boreal forest of Alberta, Canada. Using logistic regression, we test how the direction of change in moose density is influenced by measures of land cover change. In response to incremental land cover disturbance, moose declines occurred where {$<$}43\% of land cover was disturbed; in such landscapes, there were high rates of increase in linear disturbance and wolf density increased. By contrast, moose increases occurred where {$>$}43\% of land cover was disturbed and wolf density declined. Wolves and moose appeared to respond inversely to incremental disturbance with the balance between moose decline and wolf increase shifting at about 43\% of land cover disturbed. Conservation decisions require quantification of disturbance rates and their relationships to predator{\textendash}prey systems because ecosystem responses to anthropogenic disturbance shift across disturbance gradients.},

  abstract = {For species at risk, it is important that demographic models be consistent with our most recent knowledge because alternate model versions can have differing predictions for wildlife and natural resource management. To establish and maintain this consistency, we can compare predicted model values to current or past observations and demographic knowledge. When novel predictor information becomes available, testing for consistency between modeled and observed values ensures the best models are used for robust, evidence-based, wildlife management. We combine novel information on the extent of historical disturbance regimes (industrial and fire) to an existing demographic model and predict historical and projected demographics of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). Exploring 6 simulation experiments across 5 populations in Alberta, Canada, we identify the relative importance of industrial disturbance, fire, and population density to observed population size and growth rate. We confirm the onset of significant declines across all 5 populations began approximately 30 years ago, demonstrate these declines have been consistent, and conclude they are more likely due to industrial disturbance from the oil and gas sector within contemporary population ranges than historical fire regimes. These findings reinforce recent research on the cause of woodland caribou declines. Testing for consistency between observations and models prescribed for species recovery is paramount for assessing the cause of declines, projecting population trends, and refining recovery strategies for effective wildlife management. We provide a novel simulation method for conducting these tests. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Authors.

However, the effect of these changes on functional diversity (FD) remains unclear, in part because comprehensive species-level trait data are generally lacking at global scales. Here, we use morphometric and ecological traits for 8268 bird species to estimate the impact of climate change on avian FD. We show that future bird assemblages are likely to undergo substantial shifts in trait structure, with a magnitude of change greater than predicted from SR alone, and a direction of change varying according to geographical location and trophic guild. For example, our models predict that FD of insect predators will increase at higher latitudes with concurrent losses at mid-latitudes, whereas FD of seed dispersing birds will fluctuate across the tropics. Our findings highlight the potential for climate change to drive continental-scale shifts in avian FD with implications for ecosystem function and resilience.},

  abstract = {Most research on boreal populations of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) has been conducted in areas of high anthropogenic disturbance. However, a large portion of the species' range overlaps relatively pristine areas primarily affected by natural disturbances, such as wildfire. Climate-driven habitat change is a key concern for the conservation of boreal-dependent species, where management decisions have yet to consider knowledge from multiple ecological domains integrated into a cohesive and spatially explicit forecast of species-specific habitat and demography. We used a novel ecological forecasting framework to provide climate-sensitive projections of habitat and demography for five boreal caribou monitoring areas within the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada, over 90 years. Importantly, we quantify uncertainty around forecasted mean values. Our results suggest habitat suitability may increase in central and southwest regions of the NWT's Taiga Plains ecozone but decrease in southern and northwestern regions driven by conversion of coniferous to deciduous forests. We do not project that boreal caribou population growth rates will change despite forecasted changes to habitat suitability. Our results emphasize the importance of efforts to protect and restore northern boreal caribou habitat despite climate uncertainty while highlighting expected spatial variations that are important considerations for local people who rely on them. An ability to reproduce previous work, and critical thought when incorporating sources of uncertainty, will be important to refine forecasts, derive management decisions, and improve conservation efficacy for northern species at risk.},

In predator{\textendash}prey systems, prey often can anticipate the habitat use of their main predator and may use protective associates (i.e. typically an apex predator) as shields against predation. Although never tested, such mechanisms should also evolve in systems in which sexual conflict affects offspring survival. Here, we assessed the relationship between offspring survival and habitat selection, as well as the use of protective associates, in a system in which sexually selected infanticide (SSI), rather than interspecific predation, affects offspring survival. We used the Scandinavian brown bear (Ursus arctos) population with SSI in a human-dominated landscape as our model system. Bears, especially adult males, generally avoid humans in our study system. We used resource selection functions to contrast habitat selection of GPS-collared mothers that were successful (i.e. surviving litters, n = 19) and unsuccessful (i.e. complete litter loss, n = 11) in keeping their young during the mating season (2005{\textendash}2012). Habitat selection was indeed a predictor of litter survival. Successful mothers were more likely to use humans as protective associates, whereas unsuccessful mothers avoided humans. Our results suggest that principles of predator{\textendash}prey and fear ecology theory (e.g. non-consumptive and cascading effects) can also be applied to the context of sexual conflict.},

  abstract = {The Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model is the building block in modeling food chain, food webs and ecosystems. There are a number of hidden assumptions involved in the derivation. For instance the prey population growth is logistic without predation but also with predation. In order to reveal these we will start with modelling a resource-predator-prey system in a closed spatially homogeneous environment. This allows us to keep track of the nutrient flow. With an instantaneous remineralisation of the products excreted in the environment by the populations and dead body mass there is conservation of mass. This allows for a model dimension reduction and yields the mass balance predator-prey model. When furthermore the searching and handling processes are much faster that the population changing rates, the trophic interaction is described by a Holling type II functional response, also assumed in the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model. The derivation uses an extended deterministic model with number of searching and handling predators as model variables where the ratio of the predator/prey body masses is used as a mechanistic time-scale parameter. This extended model is also used as a starting point for the derivation of a stochastic model. We will investigate the stochastic effects of random switching between searching and handling of the predators and predator dying. Prey growth by consumption of ambient resources is still deterministic and therefore the stochastic model is hybrid. The transient dynamics is studied by numerical Monte Carlo simulations and also the quasi-equilibrium distribution for the population quantities is calculated. The body mass of the prey individual is the scaling parameter in the stochastic model formulation. This allows for a quantification of the mean-field approximation criterion for the justification of replacement of the stochastic by a deterministic model.},

(p.               1486               ) provide empirical evidence that plant-pollinator interactions are lost nonrandomly following habitat reduction in isolated hills in the Argentine pampas. Some types of interaction were more vulnerable to disruption than others, particularly when the specialization of the interacting was high and when the interactions were infrequent.

Characteristic three-node motifs were identified, and species were characterized according to the relative frequencies with which they occupied unique positions within the motifs. These relative frequencies and the dynamic importance of the motifs were then used to identify a species-level importance within a food web.                        ,              How species are embedded in food webs is an intrinsic species attribute and is conserved across diverse ecological communities.           ,              Studies of ecological networks (the web of interactions between species in a community) demonstrate an intricate link between a community's structure and its long-term viability. It remains unclear, however, how much a community's persistence depends on the identities of the species present, or how much the role played by each species varies as a function of the community in which it is found. We measured species' roles by studying how species are embedded within the overall network and the subsequent dynamic implications. Using data from 32 empirical food webs, we find that species' roles and dynamic importance are inherent species attributes and can be extrapolated across communities on the basis of taxonomic classification alone. Our results illustrate the variability of roles across species and communities and the relative importance of distinct species groups when attempting to conserve ecological communities.},

However, few published studies have tested this hypothesis by comparing population growth rates across broad bioclimatic gradients, and fewer still the carrying capacities of those populations. We used time series data on moose (Alces alces) population densities based on aerial census and hunter harvest data for 34 management units across Ontario to estimate local carrying capacities and intrinsic growth rates. These population parameters were then regressed against associated habitat covariates for each management unit to assess how moose demography changes across a broad gradient of productivity, habitat abundance, and timber harvest. Moose carrying capacity was found to increase with increasing forest productivity as measured by {$\Delta$}NDVI and the proportion of mixedwood stands in the forest. Both variables are plausibly indicative of high quality forage abundance for moose. Moose carrying capacity decreased with the proportion of forest stands harvested for timber annually, suggesting that immediate removal of forest stands and increased access by hunters temper maximum population size. Maximum rates of population growth by Ontario moose did not vary predictably with any of the landscape covariates tested. These findings contribute to our understanding of changes in demography across broad geographic and bioclimatic gradients and suggest that crude population estimators may be derived based on known habitat preferences and resource availability without a priori knowledge of animal abundance.},

  abstract = {Networks of species interactions underpin numerous ecosystem processes, but comprehensively sampling these interactions is difficult. Interactions intrinsically vary across space and time, and given the number of species that compose ecological communities, it can be tough to distinguish between a true negative (where two species never interact) from a false negative (where two species have not been observed interacting even though they actually do). Assessing the likelihood of interactions between species is an imperative for several fields of ecology. This means that to predict interactions between species{\textemdash}and to describe the structure, variation, and change of the ecological networks they form{\textemdash}we need to rely on modelling tools. Here, we provide a proof-of-concept, where we show how a simple neural network model makes accurate predictions about species interactions given limited data. We then assess the challenges and opportunities associated with improving interaction predictions, and provide a conceptual roadmap forward towards predictive models of ecological networks that is explicitly spatial and temporal. We conclude with a brief primer on the relevant methods and tools needed to start building these models, which we hope will guide this research programme forward.

Basic ingredients of population dynamics models are typically a growth rate, a saturation term in the form of Verhulst's logistic brake, and a functional response accounting for interspecific interactions. However, intraspecific interactions are not usually included in the equations. The simplest models use linear terms to represent a simple picture of the nature; meanwhile, to represent more complex landscapes, it is necessary to include more terms with a higher order or that are analytically more complex. The problem to use a simpler or more complex model depends on many factors: mathematical, ecological, or computational. To address it, here we discuss a new model based on a previous logistic-mutualistic model. We have generalized the interspecific terms (for antagonistic and competitive relationships), and we have also included new polynomial terms to explain any intraspecific interaction. We show that, by adding simple intraspecific terms, new free-equilibrium solutions appear driving a much richer dynamics. These new solutions could represent more realistic ecological landscapes by including a new higher order term.},

  abstract = {Predation risk, the probability that a prey animal will be killed by a predator, is fundamental to theoretical and applied ecology. Predation risk varies with animal behavior and environmental conditions, yet attempts to understand predation risk in natural systems often ignore important ecological and environmental complexities, relying instead on proxies for actual risk such as predator{\textendash}prey spatial overlap. Here we detail the ecological and environmental complexities driving disconnects between three stages of the predation sequence that are often assumed to be tightly linked: spatial overlap, encounters and prey capture. Our review highlights several major sources of variability in natural predator{\textendash}prey systems that lead to the decoupling of spatial overlap estimates from actual encounter rates (e.g. temporal activity patterns, predator and prey movement capacity, resource limitations) and that affect the probability of prey capture given encounter (e.g. predator hunger levels, temporal, topographic and other environmental influences on capture success). Emerging technologies and statistical methods are facilitating a transition to a more spatiotemporally detailed, mechanistic understanding of predator{\textendash}prey interactions, allowing for the concurrent examination of multiple stages of the predation sequence in mobile, free-ranging animals. We describe crucial applications of this new understanding to fundamental and applied ecology, highlighting opportunities to better integrate ecological contingencies into dynamic predator{\textendash}prey models and to harness a mechanistic understanding of predator{\textendash}prey interactions to improve targeting and effectiveness of conservation interventions.},

  abstract = {The Canadian Earth System Model version 5 (CanESM5) is a global model developed to simulate historical climate change and variability, to make centennial-scale projections of future climate, and to produce initialized seasonal and decadal predictions. This paper describes the model components and their coupling, as well as various aspects of model development, including tuning, optimization, and a reproducibility strategy. We also document the stability of the model using a long control simulation, quantify the model's ability to reproduce large-scale features of the historical climate, and evaluate the response of the model to external forcing. CanESM5 is comprised of three-dimensional atmosphere (T63 spectral resolution equivalent roughly to 2.8{$\circ$}) and ocean (nominally 1{$\circ$}) general circulation models, a sea-ice model, a land surface scheme, and explicit land and ocean carbon cycle models. The model features relatively coarse resolution and high throughput, which facilitates the production of large ensembles. CanESM5 has a notably higher equilibrium climate sensitivity (5.6\&thinsp;K) than its predecessor, CanESM2 (3.7\&thinsp;K), which we briefly discuss, along with simulated changes over the historical period. CanESM5 simulations contribute to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) and will be employed for climate science and service applications in Canada.},

  abstract = {Changes in temperature affect consumer-resource interactions, which underpin the functioning of ecosystems. However, existing studies report contrasting predictions regarding the impacts of warming on biological rates and community dynamics. To improve prediction accuracy and comparability, we develop an approach that combines sensitivity analysis and aggregate parameters. The former determines which biological parameters impact the community most strongly. The use of aggregate parameters (i.e., maximal energetic efficiency, {$\rho$}, and interaction strength, {$\kappa$}), that combine multiple biological parameters, increases explanatory power and reduces the complexity of theoretical analyses. We illustrate the approach using empirically-derived thermal dependence curves of biological rates and applying it to consumer-resource biomass ratio and community stability. Based on our analyses, we generate four predictions: 1) resource growth rate regulates biomass distributions at mild temperatures, 2) interaction strength alone determines the thermal boundaries of the community, 3) warming destabilises dynamics at low and mild temperatures only, 4) interactions strength must decrease faster than maximal energetic efficiency for warming to stabilise dynamics. We argue for the potential benefits of directly working with the aggregate parameters to increase the accuracy of predictions on warming impacts on food webs and promote cross-system comparisons.},

Native crucian carp (Carassius carassius) faces a severe decline in European waters and has become critically endangered in many European countries. Possible ecological mechanisms of the rapid decline of the crucian carp attributable to resource competition with the invasive Carassius gibelio were identified. A field study was combined with a controlled experiment to compare (i) standard length{\textendash}weight relationships and growth patterns in 12 Czech and Swedish ponds in which the species occur alone or in syntopy, and (ii) individual growth and food utilization under the same conditions. The growth increment of C. gibelio was greater than that of C. carassius under the same experimental conditions (mean increase in weight: C. gibelio, 21.7\%; C. carassius, 5.2\%; increase in standard length: C. gibelio, 6.3\%; C. carassius, 2.0\%), suggesting that C. gibelio uses food resources more efficiently than C. carassius does. Moreover, larger C. carassius individuals did not grow, whereas growth of C. gibelio individuals was largely independent of standard length. Field data suggested that C. gibelio grew faster and were heavier than C. carassius of the same standard length in four Czech ponds where they occurred together. Individual weight-at-length declined in C. carassius in the presence of C. gibelio, especially in more dense populations, whereas the weight-at-length of C. gibelio remained similar. Taken together, these results imply that C. gibelio has better competitive abilities for food than C. carassius and provide novel support for the long-standing hypothesis that the introduction and spread of C. gibelio causes the decline of C. carassius in European waters.},

  abstract = {Identifying ecological drivers of tick-borne pathogen spread has great value for tick-borne disease management. However, theoretical investigations into the consequences of host movement behaviour on pathogen spread dynamics in heterogeneous landscapes remain limited because spatially explicit epidemiological models that incorporate more realistic mechanisms governing host movement are rare. We built a mechanistic movement model to investigate how the interplay between multiple ecological drivers affects the risk of tick-borne pathogen spread across heterogeneous landscapes. We used the model to generate simulations of tick dispersal by migratory birds and terrestrial hosts across theoretical landscapes varying in resource aggregation, and we performed a sensitivity analysis to explore the impacts of different parameters on the infected tick spread rate, tick infection prevalence and infected tick density. Our findings highlight the importance of host movement and tick population dynamics in explaining the infected tick spread rate into new regions. Tick infection prevalence and infected tick density were driven by predictors related to the infection process and tick population dynamics, respectively. Our results suggest that control strategies aiming to reduce tick burden on tick reproduction hosts and encounter rate between immature ticks and pathogen amplification hosts will be most effective at reducing tick-borne disease risk.},

Models based on differential equations aim to understand the interactions between populations of prey and predators at population scale, but they are unable to handle spatial and individual behaviour heterogeneities (individual scale). In this study, a population-driven individual-based model is proposed that has been developed from the archetypical Lotka{\textendash}Volterra model. The population scale was retained for processes with slower dynamics, such as reproduction for both species and the natural death of predators. The individual scale was only used for the predation process, defining local rules for individual movements of prey and predators (related to a perception distance of predators and the presence of shelters for prey in the spatial environment) and to locate births and deaths. This model was compared with the Lotka{\textendash}Volterra model. Simulations were able to exhibit the overall classic periodic evolution of population sizes with local variations. The effects of spatial heterogeneity were then explored through a range of prey refuge densities. The model was implemented on the Netlogo platform. This work illustrates how both individual and population scales may be linked through methodological choices in order to focus on the impacts of spatialisation and take into account the effects of spatial and individual heterogeneities.},

This has led to new opportunities and challenges when investigating animal movement behaviour and habitat selection. Tools like Step Selection Functions (SSFs) are relatively new powerful models for studying resource selection by animals moving through the landscape. SSFs compare environmental attributes of observed steps (the linear segment between two consecutive observations of position) with alternative random steps taken from the same starting point. SSFs have been used to study habitat selection, human-wildlife interactions, movement corridors, and dispersal behaviours in animals. SSFs also have the potential to depict resource selection at multiple spatial and temporal scales. There are several aspects of SSFs where consensus has not yet been reached such as how to analyse the data, when to consider habitat covariates along linear paths between observations rather than at their endpoints, how many random steps should be considered to measure availability, and how to account for individual variation. In this review we aim to address all these issues, as well as to highlight weak features of this modelling approach that should be developed by further research. Finally, we suggest that SSFs could be integrated with state-space models to classify behavioural states when estimating SSFs.},

In addition, good moose winter habitat includes shelter from extreme temperatures, deep snow and access to secure areas to help avoid predators expecially during spring calving.

  abstract = {Starting in the 1970s, many populations of large-bodied mammalian carnivores began to recover from centuries of human-caused eradication and habitat destruction. The recovery of several such populations has since slowed or reversed due to mortality caused by humans. Illegal killing (poaching) is a primary cause of death in many carnivore populations. Law enforcement agencies face difficulties in preventing poaching and scientists face challenges in measuring it. Both challenges are exacerbated when evidence is concealed or ignored. We present data on deaths of 937 Wisconsin gray wolves (Canis lupus) from October 1979 to April 2012 during a period in which wolves were recolonizing historic range mainly under federal government protection. We found and partially remedied sampling and measurement biases in the source data by reexamining necropsy reports and reconstructing the numbers and causes of some wolf deaths that were never reported. From 431 deaths and disappearances of radiocollared wolves aged {$>$} 7.5 months, we estimated human causes accounted for two-thirds of reported and reconstructed deaths, including poaching in 39{\textendash}45\%, vehicle collisions in 13\%, legal killing by state agents in 6\%, and nonhuman causes in 36{\textendash}42\%. Our estimate of poaching remained an underestimate because of persistent sources of uncertainty and systematic underreporting. Unreported deaths accounted for over two-thirds of all mortality annually among wolves {$>$} 7.5 months old. One-half of all poached wolves went unreported, or {$>$} 80\% of poached wolves not being monitored by radiotelemetry went unreported. The annual mortality rate averaged 18\% {$\pm$} 10\% for monitored wolves but 47\% {$\pm$} 19\% for unmonitored wolves. That difference appeared to be due largely to radiocollaring being concentrated in the core areas of wolf range, as well as higher rates of human-caused mortality in the periphery of wolf range. We detected an average 4\% decline in wolf population growth in the last 5 years of the study. Because our estimates of poaching risk and overall mortality rate exceeded official estimates after 2012, we present all data for transparency and replication. More recent additions of public hunting quotas after 2012 appear unsustainable without effective curtailment of poaching. Effective antipoaching enforcement will require more accurate estimates of poaching rate, location, and timing than currently available. Independent scientific review of methods and data will improve antipoaching policies for large carnivore conservation, especially for controversial species facing high levels of human-induced mortality.},

  abstract = {It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on               Hydra               and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.},

These changes can be broadly grouped according to three nonexclusive mechanisms: (a) changes in the species composition of the networks (driven by interaction patterns of invaders, nonrandom extinction of species according to their traits, or differences among species in population responses across gradients); (b) changes that alter interaction frequencies via changes in search efficiency (driven by altered habitat structure or metabolic rates) or changes in spatial and temporal overlap; and (c) changes to coevolutionary processes and patterns. Taking spatial and temporal processes into account can further elucidate network variation and improve predictions of network responses to environmental change. Emerging evidence links network structure to ecosystem functioning; however, scaling up to metanetworks or multilayer networks may modify interpretations of network structure, stability, and functioning.},

Using aquatic food web models we study ecosystem stability as a function of food web complexity. We measured three dynamical stability properties: resilience, resistance, and variability. Specifically, we evaluate how a decrease in the strength of predator{\textendash}prey interactions with food web complexity, reflecting a decrease in predation efficiency with the number of prey per predator, affects the overall stability of the ecosystem. We find that in mass conservative ecosystems, a lower interaction strength slows down the mass cycling rate in the system and this increases its resistance to perturbations of the growth rate of primary producers. Furthermore, we show that the overall stability of the food webs is mostly given by their resistance, and not by their resilience. Resilience and resistance display opposite trends, although they are shown not to be simply opposite concepts but rather independent properties. The ecological implication is that weaker predator{\textendash}prey interactions in closed ecosystems can stabilize food web dynamics by increasing its resistance to climatic perturbations.},

  abstract = {How the complexity of food webs relates to stability has been a subject of many studies. Often, unweighted connectance is used to express complexity. Unweighted connectance is measured as the proportion of realized links in the network. Weighted connectance, on the other hand, takes link weights (fluxes or feeding rates) into account and captures the shape of the flux distribution. Here, we used weighted connectance to revisit the relation between complexity and stability. We used 15 real soil food webs and determined the feeding rates and the interaction strength matrices. We calculated both versions of connectance, and related these structural properties to food web stability. We also determined the skewness of both flux and interaction strength distributions with the Gini coefficient. We found no relation between unweighted connectance and food web stability, but weighted connectance was positively correlated with stability. This finding challenges the notion that complexity may constrain stability, and supports the `complexity begets stability' notion. The positive correlation between weighted connectance and stability implies that the more evenly flux rates were distributed over links, the more stable the webs were. This was confirmed by the Gini coefficients of both fluxes and interaction strengths. However, the most even distributions of this dataset still were strongly skewed towards small fluxes or weak interaction strengths. Thus, incorporating these distribution with many weak links via weighted instead of unweighted food web measures can shed new light on classical theories.},

Diel interactions between predators and prey are commonly assumed to be influenced by movement speeds of both predators and prey individuals, sensu the ideal gas model, but the influencing factors of diel predation dynamics have yet to be empirically examined. In this study, we apply principles of the ideal gas model to predict diel variation in kill frequency of moose (Alces alces) by wolves (Canis lupus) in northern Ontario, Canada based on GPS radio-telemetry data combined with field verification of kills. We used GPS telemetry data from wolves and moose combined with a unique data set on the diel pattern of wolf kills to test whether predator movement rate, prey movement rate, and ambient light condition influence diel variation in kill rates of wolves on moose. Our results indicate that the kill rate between wolves and moose was principally related to the effective movement rate of predators and prey, as predicted by the ideal gas model. We found little evidence that light conditions had any effect on kill rates, but rather the majority of kill rate variation corresponded to wolf movement rate, which was over an order of magnitude higher than that of moose.},

  abstract = {The abundance and distribution of species across the landscape depend on the interaction between local, spatial, and stochastic processes. However, empirical syntheses relating these processes to spatiotemporal patterns of structure in metacommunities remain elusive. One important reason for this lack of synthesis is that the relative importance of the core assembly processes (dispersal, selection, and drift) critically depends on the spatial grain and extent over which communities are studied. To illustrate this, we simulated different aspects of community assembly on heterogeneous landscapes, including the strength of response to environmental heterogeneity (inherent to niche theory) vs. dispersal and stochastic drift (inherent to neutral theory). We show that increasing spatial extent leads to increasing importance of niche selection, whereas increasing spatial grain leads to decreasing importance of niche selection. The strength of these scaling effects depended on environment configuration, dispersal capacity, and niche breadth. By mapping the variation observed from the scaling effects in simulations, we could recreate the entire range of variation observed within and among empirical studies. This means that variation in the relative importance of assembly processes among empirical studies is largely scale dependent and cannot be directly compared. The scaling coefficient of the relative contribution of assembly processes, however, can be interpreted as a scale-integrative estimate to compare assembly processes across different regions and ecosystems. This emphasizes the necessity to consider spatial scaling as an explicit component of studies intended to infer the importance of community assembly processes.},

Many of the introduced models are so-called               compartmental models               , in which the total quantities characterizing a certain system may be decomposed into two (or more) species that are distributed into two (or more) homogeneous units called compartments. We propose herein a formulation of compartmental models based on partial differential equations (PDEs) based on concepts familiar to continuum mechanics, interpreting such models in terms of fundamental equations of balance and compatibility, joined by a constitutive relation. We believe that such an interpretation may be useful to aid understanding and interdisciplinary collaboration. We then proceed to focus on a compartmental PDE model of COVID-19 within the newly-introduced framework, beginning with a detailed derivation and explanation. We then analyze the model mathematically, presenting several results concerning its stability and sensitivity to different parameters. We conclude with a series of numerical simulations to support our findings.},

  abstract = {(1) A model is developed which aims to predict the twig size a browsing moose, Alces alces, should select during winter. We assume that moose should maximize the net energetic gain of foraging. (2) The model incorporates stochastic variation in the outcome of the choice. Due to physiognomy of the trees, the moose may be unable to make a perfect choice of the optimal twig size. (3) The stochastic version of the model predicts smaller optimal twig sizes than the deterministic version does. A comparison with the chosen twig size of birch Betula pubescens in a population in Central Norway shows that the model predicts quite well the selection of twings. Furthermore, the stochastic version of the model gives a better fit to the data than the deterministic model does. (4) The tree species a temperate browsing herbivore encounters during winter may differ in shape and in the relationship between the properties of the twig (e.g. energetic content, digestibility) and twig size. The sensitivity of the optimal clip diameter to variations in those parameters was examined by numerical analyses. These simulations showed that optimal twig size was most sensitive to (i) variation in the relationship between digestibility and diameter, and (ii) the encounter rate of twigs. (5) The impact of browsing on the plant is likely to be closely correlated with the amount of biomass removed. These analyses suggest that plant species which have a few large annual shoots of high quality will be, at the same available biomass, more severely affected by herbivores than species with smaller annual shoots of lower digestibility. (6) The simulations suggest that an increase in the number of shoots produced in response to browsing may be an adaptation to reduce the impact of further browsing by modifying the herbivore's foraging behaviour.},

  abstract = {The relationship between the rates of prey capture and predator population growth is a fundamental aspect of predation, yet it is rarely measured for vertebrate predators. For the isolated wolf population on Isle Royale, annual variation in kill rate explains 22\% of the variation in wolf population growth rate. From the slope of this relationship, we estimate that the production efficiency (ratio of production to respiration) of wolves is between 0.5\% and 1.5\%. More generally, we assess the relative extent to which wolf population growth rate is affected by density dependence, prey availability (moose, Alces alces), winter weather, and demographic stochasticity. Prey availability explains the most variation in wolf growth rate (42\%), but this is only recognized after accounting for the influence of a disease-induced population crash and age structure of the prey population (i.e. number of vulnerable moose, {$>$}9 years of age). Demographic stochasticity accounts for approximately 30\% of the variation in wolf growth rate. This recognition is important, but not surprising, given that the average population size of Isle Royale wolves is 22. Previous work indicates that the effect of winter climate, as mediated through prey vulnerability and kill rates, is substantial. This work indicates that the direct effect of winter climate is weak, and explains only about 4\% of the variation in wolf growth rate (P=0.10).},

  abstract = {1. Predation rate (PR) and kill rate are both fundamental statistics for understanding predation. However, relatively little is known about how these statistics relate to one another and how they relate to prey population dynamics. We assess these relationships across three systems where wolf{\textendash}prey dynamics have been observed for 41 years (Isle Royale), 19 years (Banff) and 12 years (Yellowstone). 2. To provide context for this empirical assessment, we developed theoretical predictions of the relationship between kill rate and PR under a broad range of predator{\textendash}prey models including predator-dependent, ratio-dependent and Lotka-Volterra dynamics. 3. The theoretical predictions indicate that kill rate can be related to PR in a variety of diverse ways (e.g. positive, negative, unrelated) that depend on the nature of predator{\textendash}prey dynamics (e.g. structure of the functional response). These simulations also suggested that the ratio of predator-to-prey is a good predictor of prey growth rate. That result motivated us to assess the empirical relationship between the ratio and prey growth rate for each of the three study sites. 4. The empirical relationships indicate that PR is not well predicted by kill rate, but is better predicted by the ratio of predator-to-prey. Kill rate is also a poor predictor of prey growth rate. However, PR and ratio of predator-to-prey each explained significant portions of variation in prey growth rate for two of the three study sites. 5. Our analyses offer two general insights. First, Isle Royale, Banff and Yellowstone are similar insomuch as they all include wolves preying on large ungulates. However, they also differ in species diversity of predator and prey communities, exploitation by humans and the role of dispersal. Even with the benefit of our analysis, it remains difficult to judge whether to be more impressed by the similarities or differences. This difficulty nicely illustrates a fundamental property of ecological communities. Second, kill rate is the primary statistic for many traditional models of predation. However, our work suggests that kill rate and PR are similarly important for understanding why predation is such a complex process.},

Diffusion-driven instabilities are commonly studied as mechanisms of pattern formation in many fields of biology but only rarely in ecology, in part because some of the conditions seem quite restrictive for ecological systems. Seasonal variation is ubiquitous in temperate ecosystems, yet its effect on pattern formation has not yet been explored. We formulate and analyze an impulsive reaction{\textendash}diffusion system for a resource and its consumer in a two-season environment. While the resource grows throughout the `summer' season, the consumer reproduces only once per year. We derive conditions for diffusion-driven instability in the system, and we show that pattern formation is possible with a Beddington{\textendash}DeAngelis functional response. More importantly, we find that a low overwinter survival probability for the resource enhances the propensity for pattern formation: diffusion-driven instability occurs even when the diffusion rates of prey and predator are comparable (although not when they are equal).},

The aim of this work is to investigate the changes in predator's distribution in space as the prey populations change their mobility. We observe that the frequency diffusion of the prey gives rise to the sparse density of the predator. Moreover, we also observe that the increasing rate of the conversion into predator biomass induces pattern transitions of the predator. Specifically speaking, Turing pattern of the predator populations goes gradually from a spotted pattern to a black-eye pattern, with the intermediate state being the mixture of spot and stripe pattern. The simulation results and analysis of this work illustrate that the diffusion rate and the real intrinsic factor influence the persistence of the predator-prey system mutually.},

  abstract = {Density dependence is a fundamental ecological process. Patterns of animal habitat selection and social behaviour are often density-dependent and density-dependent traits should affect reproduction and survival, and subsequently affect fitness and population dynamics. The Ideal Free Distribution and Optimal Foraging Theory present distinct predictions about how the effect of habitat selection on fitness differs across a population density gradient. Using a social ungulate (Rangifer tarandus) as a model system, we test competing hypotheses about how (co)variance in habitat specialization, social behaviour, and fitness vary across a population density gradient. Within a behavioural reaction norm framework, we estimated repeatability, phenotypic plasticity, and phenotypic covariance among social behaviours and habitat selection to demonstrate the adaptive value of these phenotypes across a population density gradient. In support of Optimal Foraging Theory, but not the Ideal Free Distribution, we found that at high density habitat specialists had higher fitness than generalists, but were also less social than habitat generalists, suggesting the possibility that specialists were inhibited from being social. Our findings illustrate that social strength and habitat specialization varied consistently among individuals across a density gradient, but that habitat specialists maximized fitness at high density. Taken together, our study provides preliminary support for Optimal Foraging Theory as the driving mechanism for density-dependent habitat specialization.},

  abstract = {Boreal forest fire regime, which encompasses fire intensity, frequency, seasonality, size, type (crown versus surface), and severity (depth of burn), is an organizing factor of boreal forest landscapes and highly dependant on climate. This review combines what is known about boreal forest dynamics from paleological studies, with the information derived from state-of-the-art climate and vegetation modeling, to present possible scenarios of the impact of anticipated climate change on boreal forest ecosystem structure and function, particularly in relation to fire regimes. Anticipated climatic/atmospheric impact on plant physiological, communal, ecosystem, and finally landscape-level interactions with fire are reviewed. All indications from the modeling sector point towards unprecedented increased regional or seasonal temperatures, with projected changes most pronounced at high latitudes and there greatest in winter. Anticipated climate change scenarios are expected to alter dramatically the boreal forest ecosystems and fire regimes with which they are currently in equilibrium. Changed fire regimes could be represented by increased annual area burned because of an extended fire season, increased fire frequency, and severity. Simulation studies show the potential for greatly reduced boreal forest area and increased fragmentation due to climate change. Fire regime as an ecosystem process is highly sensitive to climate change because fire behaviour responds immediately to fuel moisture, which is affected by precipitation, relative humidity, air temperature, and wind speed. This interaction between climate change and fire regime has the potential to overshadow the importance of the direct effects of global warming on species distribution, migration, substitution, and extinction. Such a scenario suggests that rate and magnitude of fire-regime-induced changes to the boreal forest landscape could greatly exceed anything expected due to atmospheric warming alone. Socioeconomic implications of altered fire regimes in a changing climate are discussed in terms of adaptive fire management strategies, age class distribution, and such global stewardship issues as biodiversity, carbon cycling, and sequestration.},

Rapid industrial development continues to affect caribou habitat. Natural and anthropogenic factors, which affect population dynamics, act cumulatively. We developed an interactive cumulative effects model, which could be used to assess both natural and anthropogenic factors influencing survival of caribou. This model is based on functional and numerical responses of carnivores (wolves (Canis lupus)), herbivores (caribou and moose (Alces alces)) and resources (lichen and vascular plants). It includes stochasticity in some elements and is aspatial (but divides habitat into categories depending on habitat type and age). Based on simulation experiments, we suggest that the most detrimental factor on caribou population dynamics is the functional loss of habitat due to avoidance of good quality habitat in proximity of industrial infrastructures. We argue that in the natural boreal ecosystem, habitat was not limiting caribou in northern Alberta, and caribou could coexist with uncontrolled wolf populations that kept caribou at low densities of about 0.1km-2. We argue that wolf control is not a practical solution in caribou conservation and propose different alternatives. We also suggest potential thresholds for industrial development for specific interactions of different predation pressures and habitat carrying capacity.},

Nest losses resulted almost entirely from predators, but reliable data were not available on predator numbers so correlation with nest success was not possible.

Over 6 million km2 of the Boreal Forest biome is found in Canada (5.5 million km2) and the United States (0.74 million km2) across 10 provinces and territories and one United States state (Alaska). All of it is within the traditional territories of hundreds of Indigenous governments, many of whom are now asserting their rights to make decisions about its future and current land-use including for conservation and development. The biome is considered to be 80\% intact and between 8 and 13\% formally protected. The North American Boreal Forest biome's intactness has allowed it to retain many globally significant conservation features including long-distance mammal and fish migrations, healthy populations of large predators, one to three billion nesting birds, some of the world's largest lakes and North America's longest undammed rivers, massive stores of carbon and ecological functionality. The biome's forests, minerals, and hydropower potential are also recognized as economic opportunities so that the industrial footprint is rapidly increasing, sometimes without careful land-use planning decisions. Indigenous, federal, state, provincial and territorial governments and conservation organizations have strived over recent decades to recognize the conservation opportunity inherent in such a still-intact landscape, resulting in implementation of some of the world's largest land conservation set-asides. Indigenous governments, in particular, have been at the forefront in developing and implementing world-leading, modern land-use plans that achieve land conservation at massive scales. Supporting efforts to ensure that a high proportion of North America's Boreal Forest biome is protected and remains as intact habitat with unimpeded ecosystem processes should be a priority of the global conservation community. Federal, state, and provincial/territorial governments should support Indigenous protected area proposals, vastly increase financial support for Indigenous government land conservation and stewardship activities, and should develop new protected area co-management models with Indigenous governments. Governments should also be strongly advocating for raising the global Convention on Biological Diversity protected area goal to at least 30\% by 2030.},

  abstract = {Spatial variation in habitat riskiness has a major influence on the predator{\textendash}prey space race. However, the outcome of this race can be modulated if prey shares enemies with fellow prey (i.e., another prey species). Sharing of natural enemies may result in apparent competition, and its implications for prey space use remain poorly studied. Our objective was to test how prey species spend time among habitats that differ in riskiness, and how shared predation modulates the space use by prey species. We studied a one-predator, two-prey system in a coastal dune landscape in the Netherlands with the European hare (Lepus europaeus) and European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) as sympatric prey species and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) as their main predator. The fine-scale space use by each species was quantified using camera traps. We quantified residence time as an index of space use. Hares and rabbits spent time differently among habitats that differ in riskiness. Space use by predators and habitat riskiness affected space use by hares more strongly than space use by rabbits. Residence time of hare was shorter in habitats in which the predator was efficient in searching or capturing prey species. However, hares spent more time in edge habitat when foxes were present, even though foxes are considered ambush predators. Shared predation affected the predator{\textendash}prey space race for hares positively, and more strongly than the predator{\textendash}prey space race for rabbits, which were not affected. Shared predation reversed the predator{\textendash}prey space race between foxes and hares, whereas shared predation possibly also released a negative association and promoted a positive association between our two sympatric prey species. Habitat riskiness, species presence, and prey species' escape mode and foraging mode (i.e., central-place vs. noncentral-place forager) affected the prey space race under shared predation.},

  abstract = {In most of their arctic and subarctic ranges reindeer, caribou and muskoxen adopt generalist foraging strategies; they consume a wide variety of plants even though they feed selectively. This paper analyses some aspects of selective feeding behavior and its possible influence on animal production. Selective feeding that makes only small changes in quality or amount of food intake may cause a greatly enhanced, or multiplier, effect on animal production. In an example for reindeer grazing in arctic coastal tundra during summer, selective grazing increased digestibility by 14\% and dry matter intake by 27\%, which combined to give a 268\% increase in projected daily weight gain. Weight gain may then influence populations through control over conception rate and survival during winter. An increase by 14\% in bodyweight of young female reindeer during summer results in a 35\% increase in the probability of conception in autumn. Winter range conditions can affect birth weight, milk production and calf growth rates, all of which affect future reproduction and survival and provide additional avenues for multiplier effects.},

  abstract = {Concerns associated with growing white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) numbers in Ottawa, Ontario have motivated several studies related to the distribution and ecology of deer in the Ottawa-Carleton region. This project infers deer-population trends from deer-vehicle collisions in Ottawa, Ontario, and considers the influence of traffic volume on estimates of population dynamics from deer-vehicle collision data. Traffic volume and collision data for various road segments across suburban Ottawa were analyzed to answer questions related to the characteristics and spatial distribution of deer collisions and traffic volume in the city. Deer-vehicle collisions are increasing at a faster rate than traffic volume, suggesting that the deer population is increasing. The distribution of collisions supports the boundaries previously suggested for the location of one deerherd summer range, but not the other. Deer-collision numbers east and west of the Rideau River, a likely barrier to deer movement, were very similar, even though research and concern related to deer numbers has been concentrated west of the Rideau. More collisions occurred on 400-series highways than on other roads, suggesting that highways are a higher risk for deer collisions than other roads. The number of deer-vehicle collisions is much higher on recently constructed 400-series highways than on older 400-series highways, indicating that new highways represent high-risk areas for collisions. This research suggests that deer-vehicle collisions could be a very useful data source for inferring deer population dynamics of suburban deer, but it is imperative that significant factors affecting the number and distribution of collisions, such as category of road and traffic volume, are considered during any analyses.},

  abstract = {Simple neutral percolation models of ecological landscapes predict a critical threshold of landscape connectivity at ca 60\% coverage of cells that are permeable to movement. Using such models as an inspiration, we conducted a field experiment in which we employed an experimental model system of tenebrionid beetles (Eleodes obsoleta) moving through mosaics of grass and bare ground in which grass coverage was systematically varied from 0\% to 80\% in a random pattern. Three parameters of beetle movement pathways (mean step length, mean vector length, and net displacement rate) all showed a sharp reduction between 0\% and 20\% grass cover and no differences over further 20\% coverage increments; the mean fractal dimension of pathways (which could not be derived for the 0\% coverage treatment) also did not differ with increasing grass coverage from 20\% to 80\%. The proportion of time spent by beetles in grass patches did not increase with increasing grass coverage, although individuals spent significantly more time steps in grass in the 20\% grass-cover treatment than would be expected by chance. The distance moved per time step was greater when beetles moved over bare ground than in grass, but the mean step length while on grass was significantly lower when grass constituted only 20\% of the experimental landscape than when more grass was present, perhaps because beetles stopped more frequently on grass when little of it was present. The threshold in beetle movement through the experimental landscapes differed markedly from that predicted by simple neutral percolation models, probably because, in contrast to the models, both cover types were permeable to beetle movements and individuals moved nonrandomly. The results of this experiment indicate that definitions of landscape connectivity depend on both the spatial pattern of the landscape and how individuals move within and among patches. Moreover, it appears that movement patterns within a particular patch may be contingent on the characteristics of the surrounding landscape. As a consequence, a land-cover map alone may not predict whether, to a particular kind of organism, a landscape is fragmented or connected, and the spatial distribution of individuals in a population may not map closely onto the distribution of suitable habitat patches. This finding suggests that assessments of metapopulation structure must consider both overall landscape patterns and the nonlinear responses of organisms to such patterns.},

We studied how the re-colonization of the Scandinavian Peninsula by wolves (Canis lupus) affected the amount and temporal variation in use of moose (Alces alces) carcasses. We compared the availability of biomass from remains at wolf kills with those killed by hunters, vehicle collisions and natural death. Movement-triggered cameras monitored patterns of use on wolf kills and remains from hunter harvest by scavengers (n = 15 276) in relation to time of year, available carcass biomass, time since the death of the moose and presence of wolves. Remains from hunter harvest were the largest food source for scavengers both within wolf territories (57\%) and in areas without wolves (81\%). The total annual biomass available were similar in areas with (25 648 kg) and without (24 289 kg) wolves. Presence of wolves lowered the peak biomass available from hunter harvest in October (20\%) and increased biomass available during December to August (38-324\% per month). The probability of scavengers being present decreased faster with time at remains from hunter harvest compared to wolf kills and both the probability of being present and the number of visits by scavengers to wolf kills increased as the amount of biomass available on the carcass increased. Wolves reduced the seasonal variation of biomass from moose carcasses and most important increased it during spring. Scavengers also visited wolf kills most frequently during spring when most scavenging species have young, which may lead to an increase in survival and/or reproductive success of scavengers within wolf territories. This applies both for abundant scavenging species that were the most frequent visitors at wolf kills and threatened scavengers with lower visit frequency.},

Here we develop a modelling framework to explore the effects of different predation strategies on the response of age-structured prey populations to a changing climate. We show that predation acts in opposition to temporal correlation in climatic conditions to suppress prey population fluctuations. Ambush predators such as lions are shown to be more effective at suppressing fluctuations in their prey than cursorial predators such as wolves, which chase down prey over long distances, because they are more effective predators on prime-aged adults. We model climate as a Markov process and explore the consequences of future changes in climatic autocorrelation for population dynamics. We show that the presence of healthy predator populations will be particularly important in dampening prey population fluctuations if temporal correlation in climatic conditions increases in the future.},

  abstract = {Apparent competition is an indirect interaction between 2 or more prey species through a shared predator, and it is increasingly recognized as a mechanism of the decline and extinction of many species. Through case studies, we evaluated the effectiveness of 4 management strategies for species affected by apparent competition: predator control, reduction in the abundances of alternate prey, simultaneous control of predators and alternate prey, and no active management of predators or alternate prey. Solely reducing predator abundances rapidly increased abundances of alternate and rare prey, but observed increases are likely short-lived due to fast increases in predator abundance following the cessation of control efforts. Substantial reductions of an abundant alternate prey resulted in increased predation on endangered huemul (Hippocamelus bisulcus) deer in Chilean Patagonia, which highlights potential risks associated with solely reducing alternate prey species. Simultaneous removal of predators and alternate prey increased survival of island foxes (Urocyon littoralis) in California (U.S.A.) above a threshold required for population recovery. In the absence of active management, populations of rare woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) continued to decline in British Columbia, Canada. On the basis of the cases we examined, we suggest the simultaneous control of predators and alternate prey is the management strategy most likely to increase abundances and probabilities of persistence of rare prey over the long term. Knowing the mechanisms driving changes in species' abundances before implementing any management intervention is critical. We suggest scientists can best contribute to the conservation of species affected by apparent competition by clearly communicating the biological and demographic forces at play to policy makers responsible for the implementation of proposed management actions.},

Measuring inter-action strength is difficult because of the large number of interactions in any natu-ral system, long-term feedback, multiple pathways of effects between species pairs, and possible nonlinearities in interaction-strength functions. Presently, the few studies that extensively estimate interaction strength suggest that distributions of interaction strength tend to be skewed toward few strong and many weak interactions. Model-ing studies indicate that such skewed patterns tend to promote system stability and arise during assembly of persistent communities. Methods for estimating interaction strength efficiently from traits of organisms, such as allometric relationships, show some promise. Methods for estimating community response to environmental pertur-bations without an estimate of interaction strength may also be of use. Spatial and temporal scale may affect patterns of interaction strength, but these effects require fur-ther investigation and new multispecies modeling frameworks. Future progress will be aided by development of long-term multispecies time series of natural communities, by experimental tests of different methods for estimating interaction strength, and by increased understanding of nonlinear functional forms.},

For this, we investigate Turing instability for a predator-prey system with nonlinear diffusion terms including the normal diffusion, cross-diffusion, and self-diffusion. A sufficient condition of Turing instability for this system is obtained by analyzing the linear stability of spatial homogeneous equilibrium state of this model. A series of numerical simulations reveal Turing parameter regions of the interaction of diffusion parameters. According to these regions, we further demonstrate dispersion relations and spatial patterns. Our results indicate that self-diffusion plays an important role in the spatial patterns.},

  abstract = {Summary Measurement of the time allocation of penguins at sea has been a major goal of researchers in recent years. Until now, however, no equipment has been available that would allow measurement of the aquatic and terrestrial behaviour of an Antarctic penguin while it is commuting between the colony and the foraging grounds. A new motion detector, based on the measurement of acceleration, has been used here in addition to current methods of inferring behaviour using data loggers that monitor depth and speed. We present data on the time allocation of Ad{\'e}lie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) according to the different types of behaviours they display during their foraging trips: walking, tobogganing, standing on land, lying on land, resting at the water surface, porpoising and diving. To illustrate the potential of this new technique, we compared the behaviour of Ad{\'e}lie penguins during the chick-rearing period in a fast sea-ice region and an ice-free region. The proportion of time spent standing, lying on land and walking during foraging trips was greater for penguins in the sea-ice region (37.6{$\pm$}13.3 \% standing, 21.6{$\pm$}15.6 \% lying and 5.9{$\pm$}6.3 \% walking) than for those in the ice-free region (12.0{$\pm$}15.8 \% standing, 0.38{$\pm$}0.60 \% lying and 0 \% walking), whereas the proportion of time spent resting at the water surface and porpoising was greater for birds in the ice-free region (38.1{$\pm$}6.4 \% resting and 1.1{$\pm$}1.1 \% porpoising) than for those in the sea-ice region (3.0{$\pm$}2.3 \% resting and 0 \% porpoising; means {$\pm$} S.D., N=7 for the sea-ice region, N=4 for the ice-free region). Using this new approach, further studies combining the monitoring of marine resources in different Antarctic sites and the measurement of the energy expenditure of foraging penguins, e.g. using heart rates, will constitute a powerful tool for investigating the effects of environmental conditions on their foraging strategy. This technique will expand our ability to monitor many animals in the field.},

  abstract = {Demographic and spatial parameters of a high-density black bear (Ursus americanus) population were studied with radiotelemetry and live-capture techniques in 1974 and 1975 at Cold Lake, Alberta. During previous studies, the population on a 218-km2 study area closed to sport hunting of bears had doubled from a mean of 80 bears in 1968-71, to 175 in 1973 following the removal of 23 adult males in 1971 and 1972. The increase was attributed to increased subadult survival and ingress. By 1975 the population decreased to 137 and the adult male cohort was numerically restored. The subadult cohort remained large, however. Average weights of bears of the same age did not decrease when the population increased, suggesting that food was not in short supply at the higher densities. Size estimates for annual home ranges of males and females averaged 119 and 19.6 km2, respectively. Size of male home ranges was not affected by the density increase but size of female home ranges may have decreased. Areas occupied by 24 male bears of different ages overlapped extensively. Adult females appeared to be territorial toward one another, but tolerated bears of other sexes and ages. Mobility of male bears decreased from spring through fall and was likely influenced by seasonal food availability and breeding behavior. More subadult males moved off the study area than adult males. Male bears selected aspen and garbage dump areas but avoided muskeg habitat. Subadult males were located at garbage dumps twice as often as adult males.},

Both species follow the same symmetric growths law, but their dispersal strategies and advection rates are different. The following pattern is used to consider the competition strategy: in a bounded heterogeneous habitat, the first population disperses according to its resource functions, whereas the second population disperses according to its carrying capacity. We investigate the model in two scenarios: when carrying capacity and resource functions are non-proportional, competitive exclusion occurs, and one species drives theother to extinction in the long run for various similar and unequal carrying capacities of competing species. However, coexistence is achievable for different resource distribution consumption if the resource distribution and the carrying capacity phase of the second species are non-constant and similar. A series of numerical computations are used to demonstrate the model's efficacy in oneand two-dimensional instances, which is particularly significant for environmental consideration.},

By a brief stability and bifurcation analysis, we arrive at the Hopf and Turing bifurcation surface and derive the symbolic conditions for Hopf and Turing bifurcation on the spatial domain. Based on the stability and bifurcation analysis, we obtain spiral pattern formation via numerical simulation. Additionally, we study the model with a color noise and external periodic forcing. From the numerical results, we know that noise or external periodic forcing can induce instability and enhance the oscillation of the species density, and the cooperation between noise and external periodic forces inherent to the deterministic dynamics of periodically driven models gives rise to the appearance of a rich transport phenomenology. Our results show that modeling by reaction-diffusion equations is an appropriate tool for investigating fundamental mechanisms of complex spatiotemporal dynamics.},

  abstract = {Climate change affects ecological communities through its impact on the physiological performance of individuals. However, the population dynamic of species well inside their thermal niche is also determined by competitors, prey and predators, in addition to being influenced by temperature changes. We use a trait-based food-web model to examine how the interplay between the direct physiological effects from temperature and the indirect effects due to changing interactions between populations shapes the ecological consequences of climate change for populations and for entire communities. Our simulations illustrate how isolated communities deteriorate as populations go extinct when the environment moves outside the species' thermal niches. High-trophic-level species are most vulnerable, while the ecosystem function of lower trophic levels is less impacted. Open communities can compensate for the loss of ecosystem function by invasions of new species. Individual populations show complex responses largely uncorrelated with the direct impact of temperature change on physiology. Such complex responses are particularly evident during extinction and invasion events of other species, where climatically well-adapted species may be brought to extinction by the changed food-web topology. Our results highlight that the impact of climate change on specific populations is largely unpredictable, and apparently well-adapted species may be severely impacted.},

  abstract = {Throughout their recent recovery in several industrialized countries, large carnivores have had to cope with a changed landscape dominated by human infrastructure. Population growth depends on the ability of individuals to adapt to these changes by making use of new habitat features and at the same time to avoid increased risks of mortality associated with human infrastructure. We analyzed the summer movements of 19 GPS-collared resident wolves (Canis lupus L.) from 14 territories in Scandinavia in relation to roads. We used resource and step selection functions, including {$>$}12000 field-checked GPS-positions and 315 kill sites. Wolves displayed ambivalent responses to roads depending on the spatial scale, road type, time of day, behavioral state, and reproductive status. At the site scale (approximately 0.1 km2), they selected for roads when traveling, nearly doubling their travel speed. Breeding wolves moved the fastest. At the patch scale (10 km2), house density rather than road density was a significant negative predictor of wolf patch selection. At the home range scale (approximately 1000 km2), breeding wolves increased gravel road use with increasing road availability, although at a lower rate than expected. Wolves have adapted to use roads for ease of travel, but at the same time developed a cryptic behavior to avoid human encounters. This behavioral plasticity may have been important in allowing the successful recovery of wolf populations in industrialized countries. However, we emphasize the role of roads as a potential cause of increased human-caused mortality., We studied how wolves in Scandinavia respond to roads built to ease human travel but degrading habitat quality for many wildlife species. Wolves responded with ambivalence: They both selected and avoided roads, all depending on the spatial and temporal scale and their behavioral status. To understand the multi-scale effects of human infrastructure on animal behavior is important with regard to the recent come-back of many wildlife species to now industrialized countries.},

  abstract = {1. While teaching statistics to ecologists, the lead authors of this paper have noticed common statistical problems. If a random sample of their work (including scientific papers) produced before doing these courses were selected, half would probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques employed. 2. Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.},
